## NLP Projects
The following is my NLP related projects
-  <b>1_CA1_LabelData</b>

    Using Vadar to calculate sentiment value, Vadar is design to work with sentiment expressed in social media.

-  <b>2_CA1_Classification</b>

    Text classification using N-gram to create document vector and classify document on their sentiment value.
    Basically for this project, I aim to use users comment to classify them on their sentiment value. 
    Learning conlusion:
    - Make sure your dataset is balance
    - Using N-gram for this case is better than Uni-gram, because N-gram captures more information.
