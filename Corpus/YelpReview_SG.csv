This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality and this was one of those places that didn't have any such advertisements but the quality was definitely there.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours balanced very well and the Wok Hei was more prominent than most hawkers, it was beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.We also always order their Oluak aka Oyster Omelette which has a mix of just cooked oysters in a omelette with garlic and chives which is dipped in chilli sauce. Although I do enjoy the version of Oluak here, there is a place that does it with an extremely crispy finish, that's hard to go past. We never miss ordering it though, as I'm a sucker for a good Oluak and it goes great with the Kway Teow.It may take a little time to fine a seat at the Bedok Block 85 North complex where the food hall is situated but there is plenty to choose from whilst there and it's worth the wait. The chicken wings from the store next door are good, as is the two stalls around the corner that sit side by side to each other that serve Bak Chor Mee aka pork noodles. Just check out my other posts at Bedok Block 85 North for more information on the food available in the same complex.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and on this occasion there was plenty to wrap my mouth around and we will definitely be back.Cheers!Dave."

We got into the line at 12:22 and got our food at 10 minutes past one. If you have that kind of time this place worth the visit. We got two small bowls of Singaporean style ramen and we both enjoyed it a lot!The noodles, the broth, all the dressings were phenomenal.  The slow cooked egg was silky and creamy. Chirashi pork was delish! My boyfriend wants to come back here again after the rush hour, as you can see the line getting significantly shorter after 1:30pm. And they are open till 7:30Also since it was hard for me to find the food center I bookmarked Gayatri Restaurant, the place right outside of it, so it's easy to find it next time. The hawker center is two stories, and the Noodles are in the ground level.$7 SGD per small bowl of ramen. I think it's worth it."

The flavors in the dish are extremely fresh and the broth is very well-seasoned. 4 stars just because the service - while trying to operate most efficiently in a small space - can be a bit awkward, as you're prompted to state your order while still halfway down the line, at a point when you can't actually read the menu, so it's tough to decide any additions / modifications you may want to make to the order other than the size of the portion.

And a long line of people waiting for food, which is a good sign. I waited like 20-25 minutes to order. There's just one thing, the noodles, but you can get small, medium, or large. And you can add on extra sides (like an extra egg or more HK style wontons). The lady behind me said that the larger sizes just come with more noodles. After I placed my order for a small bowl, the light for the sign went out. The lady behind me said that that meant they ran out of stuff! I had such good timing! The noodles were SO delicious! No broth. Noodles were amazing. The hard-boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The potato wrapped shrimp was super tasty. And the wontons and chashu pork were yummy! A perfect 10.

Came with a high expectation amid the fanfare generated by the Michelin announcement, and the plethora of cool pictures on Instagram.Ordered the jumbo plate and it was.... okay. Many people loved its concept of a Singapore-style ramen, but it was fusion-confusion for me. Personally, I found it pretty weird to be eating a wanton (Chinese dish) immediately after a cha-shu (Japanese dish), In entirety, the taste profiles of the ingredients just did not blend elegantly enough. In addition, I found the noodles too cluttered in a lump, making it tough to eat. Finally, the chilli looked cool, but tasted pretty dry.Nonetheless, I was deeply impressed by the quality of the ingredients, and that the owners decided not to cut corners despite the price point and hawker-food positioning. The potato wrapped prawn was also pretty incredible - crunchy and tasty. And yes, the bowl of noodle was full of cool ingredients that would make it very much Instagram-worthy.Does it deserve a Bib Gourmand? Probably not for me, although the owners are still pretty young and will only go up from there. I applaud their audacity to sort of reinvent the wheel, and I look forward to trying their dish again in a year."

My guess is that they don't use MSG, but unlike Japanese ramen shops, don't have enough ingredients that contribute their own umami.Of course, these are small grouses given the very reasonable price of $5.5-$7.5. It's certainly worth a try if you're near Amoy."

The soup, the pork belly( imported from Spain and cooked sous vide for 36 hours) to the potato wrapped prawns and HK style wanton. Careful attention and detailed work. The result? A damn good bowl of wan ton mee. Don't expect the fiery chilli like eng's or the one at da Jie. But come here if you want a take on wanton mee by a new generation of chefs."

Also I prefer normal char siew to the cha shu that they provided here (think layers of fat + meat, I really do not like fat in my meat).Anyway, $5 noodle bowl does come with a fair bit of stuff - yummy potato strip-wrapped prawn (deep fried and certainly crisp! nice texture); 3 slices cha shu; 3 pcs wonton (v bouncy w prawn inside); fried shallots; some seasoning or other which adds some sweetness to the sauce. Pretty gd sambal too! Mee is the wonton mee texture, probably my favourite type of noodles :)It does take a while to get your food though.. Oh, it also comes with a bowl of soup."

The server / staffs manning the stall is professional enough to get your order and prepare your bowl of goodness under 10 mins. It's that impressive! I've tried other similar stalls in the CBD area and this one is less intense as compared to the others. The curry soup is not as thick and ""creamy"" (the way I like it) and once mixed with the aromatic chili served separately, hell will break loose... I mean, be prepared to sweat it out while indulging in a bowl of very delicious curry noodles. I ordered a large bowl ($5.50 if not mistaken) and the portion is just perfect. The noodles is topped with a generous portion of steamed chicken depending on the size you order.

I love my curry. Chicken curry, Fish Curry, Indian Curry, Chinese Curry, Japanese Curry, Nonya Curry.... You name it I love it and  curry chicken noodles are no exception. Curry Chicken Noodle is one of my great pleasures and certainly a comfort food. Whether it's a cold day, or after a hard day of work, nothing soothes the soul like a hot, rich, fragrant bowl of curry chicken noodles. I've heard of the 2 curry chicken noodles for the longest time but never got around to tying them. Either because we passed by when I wasn't hungry or the queues were way too long. One day, while deciding to have breakfast there, I noticed that there were only 4 people in the queue.Finally! My chance to try! As the one on the first floor was closed, I decided to try Ah Heng, the one that usually has the longer queue. Doubts started to set in once the bowl was served to me. The soup looked a bit light, obviously lacking the orange-ness that you normally find in curry noodles. There was a slight fragrance to it and well... I've learnt not to judge a book by its cover, especially for food. However, one taste of the soup and I was very sadly proven right. The soup didn't really taste like a curry chicken soup. It tasted more of a salty chicken soup with a hint of curry added, a bit like making a curry Instant noodle and realizing you added a little too much water. While the chicken was pretty tender, the lack of oomph in the curry ensured that the potatoes looked and tasted like well..... Salty boiled potatoes are there wasn't enough sweetness in soup to excite me while it was being soaked in the ""tau pok"".Sadly... I really don't see what all the fuss and long queue is about. In general, the entire dish tasted a lot like the one time I tried using canned chicken curry to make into curry chicken noodles. Similar to that incident, I will only try it once and never again."

Despite the fact that it was drier (compared to others) and uses noodles of different thickness. It was well-fried and richly flavoured. The mixture of yellow noodles and thin bee hoon had soaked up the essence of the broth and was just so delectable on its own. The pieces of squid and prawns hidden underneath the mixture of noodles and thin bee hoon were quite good too.

It is a far cry from its heydays in the 1970s when it was probably one of the best hokkien mee stalls in Singapore. I went back there today after more than 30 years to see if I could savour one of my favourite childhood dishes again. Sadly, I can only rate it slightly above average, certainly not worth waiting more than an hour for. Also quite disappointed that I could not try the cheng tng and satay bee hoon stalls. Wonder if they are still around after so many years."

(Ok, it is between this and bak chor mee)I like my hokkien mee moist, not too wet. The gravy has to taste of the sweetness of seafood and it has to be soaked into the noodles. And I like to have more bee hoon than yellow noodle.This hits all the spots. I mean all. This and Nam Sing at Old Airport Road are my fav.The only thing I am docking off is that there is always such a long wait. Even at midnight, we had to wait 20min for our plate of hokkien noodles.

Think Japanese, Korean, & Mexican. Put them all together and you get the unique flavors of Akira Back. We were a group of 10 and did not know how much to order so we asked the staff to plan a dinner for 10.  Next thing we know, food kept pouring out of the kitchen, from tacos to sashimi to rib eyes and sous vide chicken breast and finished off with signature rolls. It was way too much for us. I recommend, if you want to do what we did, to reduce the head count. So for a group of 10, I would plan for 7 or 8. That way there's room for desserts. Make sure to include the pork belly roll and you can skip the fried rice. I was too busy eating to take photos of these dishes. All of them are visually tasty too. Fantastic staff. Very nice and accommodating. Knowledgeable too.For a special night, I highly recommend Akira Back."

We were a group of 4 and started the night off with the mushroom pizza served with Ponzu Mayo and truffle oil. SO SO GOOD I could eat the whole damn pizza. Only had 2 pieces sadly. Continued with the Miso Black cod, Brother from another Mother maki roll and both the Wagyu and king crab fried rice. Each dish was tastefully done and had some great element about them. It's one of those dishes where you would think, wow I don't mind having a second portion of this because it is addictive.

One of them is Allauddin's.b) They have a giant set of clippings of prizes they have won from various local newspapers, magazines and other food raters. A few other places have prize clippings but Allauddin has far more than anybody else.So Singaporean food writers like this place.* * *Biryani (here spelled Briyani) is the order of the day.This is the best Biryani I have ever had - bar none.1) Most US or British Biryani is Indian fried rice. Colored rice with chunks of food.This stuff is drenched in a very very highly flavored curry sauce.So the fire blows out the top of your head on the first bite and stays that way.The sauce is great.The meat is great.I got fish, At first I thought there was a mix-up in the ordering because the fish was dark like mutton. One initial bite and four fish bones in my mouth convinced me that yes this was fish.But it was fish that was as dark and rich and tasty as mutton. This is a good thing.Side dishes were a spicy zucchini with a different fire sauce - and a potato curry with a third fire sauce. All three sauces were outstanding.The tamils were taking the three items dumping them all together and eating it as a combo.I kept the components separate on my plate. I would have been happy  either way.* * *Three last tips.a) Biryani comes with an optional hard boiled egg as a garnish. I recommend it to help stabilize the fire.b) The Tamils eat all this stuff with their hands. There are public sinks about five yards away from the stall. You wash your hands first, and then afterwards.Just as well that you know this because there ain't no napkins.Eating with your hands is optional. The Tamils were eating with their hands - dumping all the wet sauce all over the rice to boot - so their plate was maximally messy. Their right hands were soaked in sauce.The Americans and Aussies were eating with forks and spoons, doing our best to be tidy.The Chinese were a mixed bag. The well dressed ones with fancy leather briefcases were eating with forks and spoons. The ones in sandals and cheap clothing were eating with their hands. It is your call how you want to play this one.c) With all this fire - you are going to want a drink. Various vendors from the drink stands will come offering to bring you a drink. Take them up on it.All the drink stands (there are many) are essentially the same and charge the same amount for the same twenty or thirty drinks. Look at a menu for a drink stand - remember the name of a drink that sounds good to you - then order your food from Alauddin's and wait for a drink stand person to come around.You will be happy when he comes with the fire truck.And you will be VERY happy that you chose to set your mouth on fire at Alauddin's."

Rice + Meat + some type of gravy = comfort food in any culture. As I was downing this, it actually reminded me of my own reference point for exactly this type of comfort food: Loco Moco in Hawaii (a mound of steamed rice topped with a hamburger patty, dark gravy, and a runny egg). The effect on the eater is similar...total satiety. I sought this place out after seeing it on some internet recommendations and it did not disappoint. Located in the Tekka Center food court area, it is impressive to see that this stall has received many awards for its biryani. It was surrounded by throngs of apparent local experts as they all seemed to be able to eat with their hand while I was looking for cutlery. There also appear to be 2 stalls facing each other both with the same name. Apparently they are popular enough that 2 stalls helps to keep the size of the queue manageable at rush hour. The size of the pot that the rice and meat resides in was staggering and they are no slouches when it comes to portioning out your order. While the chicken and rice were fragrant and tender, it was the bowl of ""gravy"" that was the star of the show. I am calling it ""gravy"" because I am not really sure what the proper term for it is but it tasted of curry and was faintly fragrant of lamb which was quite nice. Spooning it over the rice made the entire plate come together. It also had some heat that snuck up on me after about 10 minutes. It was subtle and I did not notice it at first because the entire place felt like a sauna to begin with but about 10 minutes into eating it, I was pouring sweat off my forehead. One of the workers walking by actually asked me if I was ok which is now kind of comical thinking about it. He probably thought I was having the big one in the middle of the wet market! What was great about it was that I don't think I even noticed it because of the euphoria that seemed to accompany it. You know how you can get a pretty good endorphin release when eating something really spicy? That is exactly how this played out. I was feeling so good that I did not really even notice that my internal organs were spontaneously combusting. Damn that was a good plate of food for $5 SGD. If Indian food is your thing, I highly recommend seeking this place out."

We shared a chicken briyani and some crackers. YUM the chicken was amazing!!! I couldn't stop eating it and stopped myself because my husband wasn't back from getting our drinks.

It's located within Tekka market's food center. There's actually 2 stalls (located directly across each other), one for the briyani and 1 for everything else. Look out for the white sign boards! You'll see a lot of people eating with their hands here, but there's free plastic cutlery at the table in front of the store for those who'd rather not.For $4, you get a generous serving of briyani (saffron rice) and meat of your choice- fish or chicken. I'd go for the chicken! It was soft, tender and slipped easily off the bone (quite a feat considering that I was using flimsy plastic cutlery to do this). The fish came deboned so it was easy to eat, and was not too dry. It also comes with a small bowl of curry that was flavorful but not spectacular. Still, I had cravings for a week after trying this.Pair it with a teh halia for a truly satisfying meal!"

The meat falls from the bone at the slightest pressure of the fork. The rice is fragrant, spicy, but they don't score very well with presentation! Rice is scooped onto styrofoam plates, the meat of your choice is placed on top of it and covered with more rice. Achar is ladled onto the rice and a styrofoam bowl of curry is put onto the the plate. That's what customers are served.Instead of metal cutlery, plastic cutlery is provided. I didn't feel like dirtying my hands at one time, so I used those.  The strangers who were sharing the same table as us straight away said to me, ""Use your hands! Eating Indian food with cutlery is like making love to an interpreter"". Oh, okay. I was famished, so that comment didn't stop me from wolfing down my briyani.Told my Indian-Arab grandmum about the incident and she laughed out loud.

Exec Chef Johari and his Chef de Cuisine Zaini, Singaporeans lend unique flavors to their dishes. Every bite is an adventure. Front of the house is helmed by long term Manager and Sommeller Saravana who makes sure the service is impeccable. Nothing is too difficult and if you need something special, they will move mountains to get it done. Price wise, it's in the upper end, but considering it's a Michelin star restaurant, frankly a bargain. If you don't want to burn a hole in your wallet, consider heading there for lunch. At under $40 per person for a 3 course meal, you can sample chef's artistry in the cheap, though I warn you that you will likely go for the full monte dinner 6 or 8 course menu at a later date.

However, after a few minutes of being warmly welcomed by the staff my friend & I knew we had made a good decision. The food further cinched that notion as our meal was absolutely delicious. We did the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing, and every dish that came out was more delicious than the prior one. Two of the standout dishes for me were the crispy pork belly with mustard and kale (cooked perfectly crispy) and the chilled angel hair past with seaweed and lobster.  The wines were also perfectly suited for each dish and the pours were very generous, although admittedly the sommelier didn't always pour the paired wine when we got each dish - not a huge deal. The restaurant did fill up as the evening progressed yet we were happy to see the service remained very attentive even so. All in all, we were very impressed with Alma and both felt it may be under-rated as a one star.

I can't quite give you a course by course breakdown of what I had since each dish was so artfully created with flavors influenced from so many different cultures. I tasted a mix of Indian and French in one course, Thai and Persian in another, it was just beautiful. Even if I could describe what the courses were, they wouldn't do it justice since it is just so abstract.

Another dish that left an impression that night is definitely the Carrots 4-Way. Like the bread basket, i'm not a fan of carrots but after having that dish it changed my perception of carrots.

You rarely find freshly sliced ginger flowers used for fragrance in rojak anymore.   All this all together and you end up with rojak that has plenty of crunch, taste and flavour!

We thought a 1.7kg piece between 8 adults and 1 voracious pre-teen, would be a bit of an over-kill.  But I guess its never a problem when its cooked to perfection.  After displaying the cooked product to us, it was taken back to the open kitchen for the sous chef to dissect into tiny tasty morsels.  Oh my, I'm still dreaming of it in my mouth even though its now 3 evening ago I had it."

First, the rib eye was thin.  I mean I have seen many burgers that are thicker than the rib eye here.  But the fact they cooked it properly was amazing so kudos there.  Second, while blasamic-based dressing was ok, it might be nice to have an option like blue cheese.  Finally, the frites were so so.  Perhaps it is because I had the best frites at sb bistro earlier in the week, but the frites tasted like they were cooked in a less than fresh batch oil.  The place is fairly spacious so I would definitely go with a group, and the platters are a great way to take care of the table.  A nice option on Tanjong Pagar road!"

For the prices, they should be a top-notch experience but it is not. Our appetizers were great, but the meat quality in the mains was just lousy, but very well cooked. The food runner seemed angry at us when our order came out incorrect. When you pay $50USD for a steak, you expect a pretty good experience. While they claim that the food is French, it's the same vaguely continental food you can get other places. The mashed potatoes were watery, the other sides were merely adequate. As a last insult, they only had table-side salt, not just shakers. They may think that freshly ground salt is a good idea, but it is not. We wouldn't need salt if you didn't underseasoned the food..and then when we try and salvage it, they add salt to the would (pun intended) by not having simple salt and pepper shakers.This exemplifies what is wrong with the restaurant. A handful of good ideas ruined by trying too hard to be fancy and elegant. It just comes off as clumsy."

The owners seem to be gunning for a smart casual, chic restaurant but the average prices you're paying for mains ventures into fine dining territory.We tried the octopus salad and something I can't recall now for starters, before sharing the seafood and meat platters and a pasta for mains. I thought the charred ribeye was very well executed and the lamb chops were faultless, but the meat platter as a whole seemed to suffer from a rather one dimensional flavor profile. The seafood platter had some succulent prawns and a well cooked john dory, but the fish didn't blow my socks off (try Blu Kouzuna). The ravioli (or whatever you call those little pockets of goodness) was tasty and heavy on cream. I also wanted to order the rotisserie duck but was unaware that you need to order it 4 days in advance. In sum, the food was good but not excellent, much as I wanted it to be.Service was proficient, which I guess in Singapore is enough for one to breathe a sigh of relief. The waiter that took our orders was a little sassy, pointing out that we weren't in the know about having to pre-order the duck like another table did. The pacing of the food was ok at the start but soon lengthened into very long wait times between our mains, which none of my family members appreciated and so we ended the evening a little blah."

Service is impeccable (Steered by a kiwi, I may be biased...) and the barman will make a cocktail to suit your tastes. The tartines are a must... I had major food envy when sampling my fellow diners plates. The fries are done to perfection (like an upper class KFC - which is a compliment in my book!). I shared the charcuterie board which was very French (expect terrines and all sorts of cold meat concoctions), the special which was Oxtail Ravioli and warrants the term ""amazeballs"" and their trademark apple pie which was rather delicious but wasn't warm enough for my liking unfortunately. I've already mentioned the fries, but the mashed potato and the mushrooms were also perfection in a side dish. Delicious aromas permeate the place although I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the décor... the massive painting of a cherub (I think that's the term for baby angel?) was a bit naff in my opinion, as was the glittery curtains. But the charming staff and appealing menu made up for a few glitches in interior design. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a decent European dining experience, although prepare to pay for it... We paid $260 per couple (albeit, 3 courses and some wine)."

There's nothing to pay for service nor eating area. Just grab your food and find a table. That's why I love eating in hawker centres.I'm no expert on Fish Head Bee Hoon, as it's not one of my usual hawker choices. However, after trying this one from Beach Road Fish Head Bee Hoon, it has become a favourite! I love the light, milky, fish stock soup, as well as the slippery, thick rice vermicelli. The meat from the fish's head is cooked to perfection, stiff enough to grasp with chopsticks, but not tough or rubbery, and it falls apart nicely when eaten. This particular stall is awesome, because there is a generous serving of sliced fish. It is infuriating when you get lots of noodle, soup and vegetable, but just two pieces of meat. There's another version in which the fish is fried in batter, which I'm eager to try - an excuse for another visit!"

And for a Michelin Star, this was personally the worst food experience with any of them worldwide.The other Yelpers that reviewed Beni are definitely very credible so I truly believe that the restaurant just had an off night when I was there.Now I'd like to say that the sommelier and the service were both impeccable. The wine that was recommended was phenomenal and probably the best wine I've ever had. I was also very appreciative to the team for accommodating my date and I very last minute although I would highly recommend that if you are to dine here, ONLY do so if you are seated at the counter so you can enjoy watching your food artfully being prepared.However, when the food started to come out, we my date and I both were shocked at the blandness of the first few courses. Then one raw sweet shrimp course came that tasted spoiled, as much as I love sweet shrimp or live raw shrimp, I just couldn't eat this.Then was a course that was supposed to wow us - a very expensive tea that had strong umami and tasted like seaweed. That wasn't that cool.Then they brought out a very bland truffle puree type course. At this point I was about ready to pay the bill and walk out in frustration which was a first for me to do. Luckily they moved us to a better seating at the counter and the courses began to be only slightly better with a beef dish which had nothing special and a special expensive rare chocolate that had very little flavor.With the options in Singapore for both Michelin and not, I again just can't justify coming back here, but who knows. Maybe if someone else pays the bill, I'll come back :)"

You wouldn't be blamed for not knowing much about exclusive Japanese-French fine dining establishment by Chef Kenjiro 'Hatch' Hashida (also better known for his Hashida establishment). Well unless you're one of the privileged 15 pax who has snagged a seat around the open industrial bar. Then, you would be able to dine on the exquisite seasonal French omakase that also changes daily, depending on what is fresh. Expect the usual (or perhaps fanatical) dedication to excellence by the team of Japanese chefs led by Chef de Cuisine, Kenji Yamanaka. You'd see precisely plated dishes of specific temperature, served in particular ways. The result was impressive and truly enjoyable, which is expected considering the price tag you're paying. It's $127/228 for a 5 course lunch, or $298 for a 7 course dinner (with more premium ingredients). But of course, indulge further with a tea, wine, or sake pairing. We started with the King of Green HIRO premium, a Gyokuro Japanese tea. I've never thought of green tea having that umami flavor until this one. After the first brew, olive oil and salt was added to the mix and we were told to eat it up. That was when the umami was enhanced and it tasted like seaweed. Next, the Miellefeuille de Crabe Royal au Nayet SHOGOIN. A Hokkaido red king crab layered with pickled Shogoin turnip (using rice vinegar), and a Shungiku sauce (made from Japanese spinach). The light refreshing flavor of the turnip was punctuated with a slightly strong vegetable sauce. That said, it was still balanced with the sweetness of the crab and briny caviar.The Gateau au Foie Gras was a generous and creamy 3 layered foie gras cake. The bottom layer of marinated foie gras was super smooth, the middle a Jonathan apple celeriac puree, and the top was the Johnathan Apple skin jelly. I liked how the foie gras was balanced with the refreshing and slightly tart Apple and it's a nice depart from the usual berry pairing.The Homard Bleu took the cake home with the rich crustacean cream coasted risotto with cep mushroom duxelles and plenty of shaved truffles. Of course, it was topped with impeccable pieces of succulent lobster and a salty Parmesan crisp for contrasting flavors and texture. The Kinmedai Origine mer du Japon paid homage to the Japanese roots with the lingering freshness of yuzu in the flavored white wine cream sauce, and also chunks of soft yuzu peel. By presenting the steamed red snapper with scallop mousse wrapped in butter lettuce, the typically one dimension textured fish dish was lifted with the juicy crunch and coolness of the vegetable. I cannot resist the exclusive A5 Ozaki Wagyu from Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan, a precious piece of tenderloin baked in a matcha salt crust to maintain its moisture. The meat was simply drizzled with a super umami Madeira wine sauce which was reminiscent of marmite. Chef made it rain with black truffle coullis for that added earthy perfume. Oh, and Beni's rendition of potato puree was the next best thing after Joel Robuchon, though I found it to be slightly starchy. Next, a simple Brie Cheese salad served on a heated glassware for that melty texture. Simple but gorgeous, and thoughtful. We were then presented with a pre-dessert of Murata strawberries, fragrant rose jelly, and milk granite, which was delicious but I found it too sweet as a palate cleanser. That said, it was a decent dessert on its own.Desserts kind of missed the mark at Beni. I wasn't a fan of the Chocolat Framboise as it was on the sweet and heavy end. The raspberry mousse in the chocolate sphere failed to give the dish a much needed tartness to balance the flavors. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the curdy panna cotta texture. Plus a surprise birthday cake of semifreddo (which was simply.. cream). Finally the last course, cafe ER mignardise. As full as I was, I continued popping these little desserts, which fared better than the actual desserts. A cloud like calamansi marshmallow finally gave me the acidity I needed to end the meal. Followed by a dense and nutty cherry financier (lovely), an average blueberry tart, and little morsels of caramel coated Rice Krispies. Great meal at BENI nonetheless, perhaps save the dessert space for Hashida Garo next door. The Japanese are really good at what they do, regardless of the cuisine. Try this definitely."

There are a number of ice cream parlors along the stretch but this store is one of the better ones.Overall, it's ok to check out the flavors at this place, but do expect to part with a few more dollars. It's S$4.70 for a single scoop, S$7.70 for a double scoop and $1 for the cone."

Sometimes the biryani will come in a neatly packed dome shape, and other times it'll come a bit disheveled and shoved in front of your face. All up to your luck and their mood I guess.Don't expect much in the way of service here. It's pretty low-maintenance. You have to call over the waitstaff pretty insistently for anyone to come and help or serve you. Kulfi is a really interesting indian ice cream that's not too commonly found in Singapore. It's simply ice cream with some spices/pistachios in a little plastic cup. You have to rub it in between your palms to get the popsicle out. The ice cream also has various spices and pistachios sprinkled in it. Quite simple, but also quite comforting and refreshing; a great way to end the meal."

However, after trying the chicken biryani, I have concluded that the bad reviews are coming from Singaporeans that are used to their own version of briyani(which has its own separate appeal), that's covered in curry/gravy. This type of biryani is completely different. No need for the sauce, all the flavor has been soaked into the perfectly cooked rice. The server wasn't there to please, but when the meal came so quickly, I didn't mind at all especially after my expectations for the meal were exceeded. I'd probably give a 4/5, but I think some people harshly give 2 or 3 stars for arbitrary reasons that have to do with things other than the quality of the food, like their ego. 5/5."

The latter is only available on certain days but the portion of meat is super generous for $15. I'm scared of gamey meat, but my foodie friends swear by the mutton and kid goat, so next time I shall drag them along and pinch some off of them to try.The lassi is fabulous - rich and creamy, and not sweetened to tooth aching levels.

Sometimes the rice feels powdery & a bit dry but that was probably because of the weather. The key to a great Biryani is that the meat & rice needs to be slow cooked in traditional spices for it to be at it's juiciest best. That is exactly how the owner approaches this complicated & subtle dish.This is as authentic as it gets & it's NOT that brown goop they serve with yellow rice at most places which even the owner at Bismillah agrees is an abomination! Biryani was the dish of Mughal emperors & soldiers & signified feasting in a royal manner. It was considered a complete meal in itself & it is with that respect for tradition & flavour that the owner/chef Arif bhai cooks it. It is his love for crafting this complex dish that adds to the old school charm of this place in addition to the brilliant food.

Would go down really well with an ice cold beer.Before I forget, the mutton biryani has a clear edge over the chicken version."

The flavors of most of the dishes were just beautiful and unique, the feel of the restaurant being as if I eating inside the kitchen of a huge restaurant, and the service was kind and generous. Highly recommend.I was caught off guard by this experience as I recently lost much of my intrigue with Michelin Stars in Singapore but found this one to be spot on.Reservations for weekday seatings were very easy via their website which I believe uses Quandoo. We simply made a 7:30 res and took an Uber to the restaurant where we walked into a giant kitchen with only 6-8 tables in the entire dining room. At the time there was only one other seated party of 2, later there was a party of 4.My friend and I ordered the following:1) Pasta with Razor clams - This one is a MUST. WOW.2) Pasta with Uni or Crab - Pass on this one. Get the razor clam one3) Pasta with Barnacles - Unfortunately I misunderstood the waitress. Thought she said the barnacles are prepared by itself, not with another course of pasta. The barnacles were very good but I would suggest you not get it with pasta if you already ordered the razor clams.4) Roasted Pigeon - Best pigeon I've had, not gamey at all. 5) Wild Snapper - Excellent6) Strawberry Cheesecake - Fluffy, light, pink, Instagram worthy7) Their signature dessert (Starts with a G) - Very rich. Nice flavor but the sweetness is a bit much after the first bite.They also provided us a special Italian bread that they fly in every week from Italy.The chef is actually there and serves us himself many of the dishes. I love restaurants like this, very personal. Because the kitchen is right in front of you and in a sense, invades your space, you feel like you are watching a TV show with your food being prepared. It's awesome.The Boat Quay location is wonderful as well but can be hard to find. Keep an eye out for the signage and your Google Maps.Only negative at the moment is the quality of their cocktails if you do visit their rooftop bar. I ordered the bramble which was horribly sweet for a simple bramble (although the blackberry ice sphere was cool). My friend got one of the Sours which tasted awful. We barely drank them and left, hopefully it was a one time thing."

The food is among the most refined and subtle Italians you'll find in Singapore. However, what makes Braci truly unique is, because the restaurant is so small, you can engage in conversations with the staff, and especially with the talented and enthusiastic polyglot chef Beppe De Vito, a real artist. If Braci were larger (and demonstrate it could achieve the same quality with scale), it would have two Michelin stars, not one. That said, although the dishes are innovative, beautifully plated and refined, the nearby Osteria Art (also owned by chef Beppe) serves more hearty Italian meals (especially the pastas, which are the best in Singapore!) Incidentally, very good wine list, with many 'reasonably-priced' Brunello's and Barolo's."

Tasted more like a green pesto with heaps of parsley spooned on top of escargot. Don't touch the metal plate they're served on - it's HOT! I burned myself while shifting the plate.Next up was scallops on a bed of asparagus in a cream sauce for my main. My four scallops were seared BEAUTIFULLY. I could find no fault with the dish. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes, and yes, they were flawless too.My friend had the lamb, and while they didn't ask him how he wanted it done, it came sliced and was done rare. Beautiful way to treat a great piece of meat (I'm not being sarcastic). I love lamb done rare, but if you don't, be sure to mention it!Dessert for me was the Crêpe Suzette, which they lit up in front of me, with blue fire dancing on my plate. I wish they'd put more alcohol so the fire would char some of the sugar off! My crepe came smothered in a very sweet Grand Marnier sauce. It wasn't too bad but it was too sweet for me. My friend's rhubarb tart was disappointing too, with some crumbly tart AND rhubarb paste under it. HMMM. I guess they don't do desserts very well here.No fear, come here for everything but dessert, wash it down with some Billie Salmon champagne, and go for dessert elsewhere. Enjoy!"

We ordered a salmon tartare($24) to share for entree, which was a good thing as it was a very generous portion, more than adequate to share. Avocado, lettuce, dill and capers made for a very fresh and tasty starter. My main was ribeye with bearnaise and frites ($48). When it first arrived it looked ""meh"", but a quick slice open revealed it was cooked to perfect medium rare done-ness. Nicely seasoned and with a good 'crust'. The bearnaise was EXCELLENT and I had to try hard to not smear More onto my steak and end up with a heart attack. Frites were pretty standard, but generous. My partner had St Jermaine scallops with spinach and porcini. Very tasty, well cooked scallops on a bed of spinach with what I think was confit garlic. Unfortunately we left no space for dessert, but I want to try that cheese plate....A special mention for the bread. Very, very good bread. Definitely will be back to try something else.

The staff were on point.  The presentation of the large wood framed menu was impressive and there's a remarkable amount of choices in each category.  I selected the Ribeye Steak Frite ($48) and it was AMAAAZING!  The 300g portion of beef was perfectly seasoned and seared - crispy on the outside and perfectly rare on the inside. It's up there with Luke's or Morton's quality and one of the best steaks I have had in Singapore.  Served with a generous portion of perfectly cooked fries and bearnaise sauce. After we cleaned our plates and several glasses of wine later -  we ordered a selection of desserts for sharing.  Too high on life to remember them, but I had a bite of each and they were top notch (See the photos)The Good:  A nearly perfect lunch.  The Ribeye Steak Frite was delicious.  The staff was friendly and helpful.The Bad:  It's too pricey to be my new go to neighborhood lunch spot.  I would not be able to resist ordering the steak frite each time.  I must work harder to get a promotion and a raise.The Verdict:  Yes. Yes. Yessssss!"

So I did the usual search, read reviews and decided to try this restaurant and I must say, I am not disappointed at all.Located on a street just off the main thoroughfare of the Central Business District, the restaurant boasts a fine patronage of diners, mainly Caucasians and occasional locals. As you step into the place, you immediately get a feel of the Parisian air. We ordered the usual French fare; traditional onion soup, smoked salmon salad, shredded duck confit and the lobster and seafood  with bechamel sauce and the escargots done in burgundy and garlic butter.My daughter who had the onion soup exclaimed that the bowl seemed bottomless, so you could imagine the portions of the servings. My favorite was the lobster and seafood dish. The cream was not too rich. There was a generous helping of the seafood. Personally, I felt that the escargots could do with a little bit more of the garlic butter, nonetheless, what I had was pleasant enough. The service was impeccable too. The French butlers were attentive and non discriminatory, unlike others, who tend not to want to serve the Asians.This restaurant certainly has my vote for good food and good ambience.

Skip lunch and come straight for dinner!! Order the steak! Order the tartar..delicious! I don't know about you, but eating a large chunk of steak isn't usually how I do lunch--I'm a lady after all. I save my bloody meat thirst for dinner, complemented with some fine wine, and  Brasserie Gavroche definitely delivers. I dined with three others and we all enjoyed our meal. Well, I didn't enjoy my entree but I fell in love with the wine and dessert! We ordered the tartar, flank, steak, and veal. The steak was the star of the show--juicy and earthy due to the grass-fed cow from Ireland. Who knew Ireland produces such good steaks?! The next star was the veal. The description of the menu does not do it justice. Though I only had a small bite, it was everything I dreamed of but more!  I would personally pass on the flank and veal. The veal was my dish and I knew from the first bite onwards, I had made the wrong choice. Others in my party enjoyed it, but for me..meh. Though I had ordered the veal medium rare, it was tough nonetheless. I like my veal to be extremely tender and I really couldn't taste the difference between the veal and the flank. The flank was good, but nothing compared to the steak and tartar.For dessert, be sure to get the baked Alaska with brandied cherries! Once it arrives, they set it on fire in front of you! Hot damn! The chocolate is rich and dark and draws you in with the mouthful of brandied cherries. The Alaska is a decent size so I definitely recommend sharing it among friends. Brasserie Gavorche had a great wine list and for the price of the meal ($60 for food and wine), I couldn't have asked for anything better."

A four-course dinner with amuse bouche and a palate cleanser is priced at $55++, you're only allowed to make adjustments to the main course for a slight price increase.And it's good food for the price. Italian home-cooked fare, strongly seasoned with Singapore and Japanese flavours. The star of the evening that I was there, was the Oven-baked cod with spicy crust, specifically the spicy crust.

Literally. We felt like we were guests in a very warm and cosy apartment with great unpretentious food and wine, complete with soothing jazz playing softly in the background and lovely photographs on the walls.Food: Excellent! We had a complimentary amuse bouche of duck with plum crostini which was a nice teaser for the dishes to come. The Buko Nero tau kwa tower is deceptively simple, but is in fact a delicious complex blend of flavours. My main of cod with seafood bisque reduction (not on menu, one of three mains of the day) was marvellous, while my dessert of dark chocolate and peanut butter with strawberry ice cream was simply amazing. The peanut butter tastes somewhat like pureed min jiang kueh filling instead of the regular synthetic tasting variety one conventionally finds in supermarkets. Absolutely wonderful! Friend had wagyu beef carpaccio and Australian tenderloin and clearly enjoyed it.Service: Tracy was a good hostess, very attentive.Ambience: Warm, cosy and laidback. We felt totally at home.Buko Nero is definitely worth a visit, and several revisits. In fact, we both made our reservations for the next available date. I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu, including the pumpkin basil crabmeat soup, the salmon with nori, the cod with squid ink crust, the tiramisu panna cotta, etc. Buko Nero has a five course set meal for SGD 48 and they're quite flexible in that one can order the items off the set ala-carte or take the set meal and replace the main with any of one's preferred choice."

Of course, our expectations were high considering the reviews on yelp. The decor of the place was simple and almost casual, but it was nice and quiet. The service was great, very attentive staff, and the food is always served with a smile. They did not allow any pictures of the food, so unfortunately I can't contribute anything on that front, but I can tell you about the food! We were first served with a amuse bouche of cherry tomatoes, minced beef tartare and a pepper, and the one-bite dish was pretty good. The sweetness of the tomato complemented the saltiness of the beef. Next, we had a hamachi tartare with citrus, which was decent as well. The chopped hamachi was buttery, albeit a slight fishy taste, but the flavors were good. I had the basil, broccoli and crabmeat soup. The crabmeat was sweet, but the soup just lacks the umami flavor, just slightly salty and fell flat. I had the charcoal-infused home-made pasta with salt cod. The pasta had a good texture, obviously home made, although I could not taste the charcoal. Again, the sauce was just salty, with no other notes, and not much of a flavor profile. It wasn't bad, just wasn't very impressive. Deron had the smoked ricotta and beet risotto. The texture of the risotto was good, and the smoked cheese flavor was very good, but it was served luke warm and was a tad too sweet (not sure if it was due to the beet), but at the end of it, it just tasted a little like cranberry. Again, I have to emphasize that nothing was bad about the meal, and perhaps we were just expecting a little more and it did not satisfy."

And I heard that the chef/owner is Italian so I got my hopes up. Unfortunately I found the experience to be underwhelming. They had a hamachi carpaccio as a special appetizer that sounded interesting. None of the other specials grabbed me so I ordered the risotto entre off the main menu. I really liked the concept of the hamachi, but the delivery was stunted by the hamachi itself. There was more than a bit of a funk to it; definitely not sashimi-grade so it should not have been served raw. And the risotto was flat. I'm a sucker for a good risotto, but this one failed on every level. The rice was chewy, almost crunchy and there was no umami. Overall just bland a chalky. I've heard good things about Buko Nero so perhaps I just order the wrong things. Maybe I should have asked for more guidance from the nice hostess, but I don't think I'll be back to find out."

We were seated at the high top tables, but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well. If you are in town without reservations, I would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it! If you have a choice, go with the table top seating.....you can watch the magic happen. Cocktails were phenomenal (one has burnt sage on top-super fragrant), and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates. The Jacobs Ladder (meat from between the ribs) was fatty and delicious, and had a great mustard sauce. The jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous. The pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor. The king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course, decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers (yum!).

When your reservation (that you make 3 months in advance) says ""bar seating"" what they really mean is wall seating. Your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall. When we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for. Fine. Seat us then. Our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini, we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalapeño brine. We tried several starters, Grissinni (simple and tasty), Jerk chicken (pass - it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo) and the Beef Marmalade (which was the best dish we sampled). The Marmalade was delicious. We also tried the Sanger sandwich (while good, it was missing an element of flavor). Maybe some spice could highlight the flavors? And last we were recommended to try the venison. Unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for. I expect more at this price point and for the hype. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere. I would have preferred roasted meat from a Hawker stall."

It was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it.

I was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted great with the meat.Berry Tart ($12+)It was the dessert item of the day. Served with chantilly cream, although I wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it. Looked simple, it tasted quite good without too tart. I like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite.Overall food was great. Although the counter seats were full, the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal."

We were greeted by servers with a strong Australian accent, ""Howdy mate"", and saw that the restaurant was still packed at 11pm. We managed to get the last two seats at the counter (basically the entire restaurant are counter seats) and was told that only the pulled pork burger was available as their restaurant was closed. So that saved us from making choices. My husband then asked if they had fries since I wanted some with my burger. Sadly the kitchen was closing so they didn't have any but we got the beef marmalade instead. In short, food was amazing! The beef marmalade was remarkable. Shredded beef in wondrous flavor on a crispy piece of bread. Pulled pork burger is probably a good portion for a main meal but perfect when we shared it for supper. The flavors were again a delight to my tastebuds but I have to be honest the pulled pork could be a little more tender. Probably a 8/10 execution for the burger and 10/10 for the beef marmalade. We also ordered a smoky cocktail - the bartender burnt the sage. It was lightly sweet and not overwhelmingly strong. A great experience overall and I am definitely curious to be back to try their other main dishes, which by the way, rotates frequently. Reservations are only taken for dinner seating between 6-630pm, and walk ins usually have an hour to two wait. Or you could wing it like us, come by for a late night supper dish!"

I saw many people being turned away after I sat down.    I ordered the miso eggplant, the romaine salad, the steak, and a mint ice cream for dessert. This was a bit too much food for one, I realized late, but it was fabulous! I specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare, which I don't usually do, but it was so, so, so good. The steak comes with a small salad, so the romaine salad was really unnecessary - it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me.

So with this in mind and the fact that they are highly acclaimed as well it should actually be five stars and they could so easily be given that from me.The failing is however the service. Part of the service is fine and that would be the chefs behind the counter. They make the food and manage to be friendly and do a bit of talking to customers as well. The waiters and waitresses have however on every occasion been bad. First visit I asked the girl serving us how many dishes she would recommend for the two of us - response was 'how should I know howMuch you want to eat'. Great attitude.

We did sort of a tasting across the menu since we don't really know much about Australian wines, and the drinking was about as good as the eating.The service in general also stands out. Many staff ensuring the water was full, checking to ensure we were enjoying, clearing our plates, new silver etc. I broke a wine glass on accident right when we sat down and they were right there to sweep it up and re-set the table with new water glasses, silver etc to avoid any glass shards getting in the food.

For most of the dishes I didn't even know the names, really...But what I can highly recommend: - The BURNT ENDS SANGER (pulled pork burger). It was extremely juicy and flavourful, the only pity was that we had to share it among us friends. I could eat the whole thing by myself for sure! This is one of their signature dishes.- Blackmore's Cube Roll. I think this is steak that we ate. Done medium rare, it was well grilled and seasoned, and the quality of the meat was obvious. The only con to this was the almost $140 price. This is one of their signature dishes too.- Alaskan King Crab and Garlic. Oh man, the king crab was very well cooked over the garlic sauce. The sauce was well prepared, no taste of bitterness at all. Dip a piece of sourdough bread in it and devour it. Savour every last bit of the sauce. Surprisingly, this is coming from a restaurant known for their meats.If you haven't eaten at Burnt Ends, reservations (as of this past weekend) are filled till September. Talk about a long wait!Pros:- Great view of the kitchen and chefs working- Amazing food really, they are known for their meats- Good and warm service from both chefs and floor alikeCons:- Might be considered expensive; Our bill came up to about $150 per pax- Long reservation wait, if you DO manage to get it- Noisy restaurantant"

My gf and I dined at Andre previously and Burnt Ends was mentioned highly even from their staff so we took the plunge and made the reservation, preparing ourselves for eating some MEAT.We had the early 6 PM seating on a Wednesday so arrived right at 6 on the dot and had the first two counter seats. The ambiance immediately strikes you as a cool and hip place with old school punk rock music playing and young chefs hailing the kitchen. The open kitchen + counter seating setting is always a plus, allows you to watch and wow over the entire process from the moment you order your food, to it being announced, to preparation, to cooking, to serving. Each of their 10 visible chefs with different roles and stations - totally makes for one incredible experience even before you taste your food.We ordered the following:1) Leek with hazelnut and black truffle - nice tasting and perfectly grilled leek except was way too salty for my taste. This is subjective yes but even in being lenient, this was a bit much. The black truffle was even overpowered by the salt.2) Garlic shoots and gremolata - Great starter. Not too overwhelming of garlic.3) Fennel, Orange and Burrata - Loved the fennel and burrata but the the orange syrup was a bit too artificial tasting and didn't seem to belong. It took away from the freshness of the rest of the dish for me.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger (Pulled pork shoulder, home made cole slaw, home made chipotle aioli, brioche bun) - Loved this. Can eat 4 of these.5) Suckling pig for 2 - Good but be prepared to work! Excellent flavor from the charcoal grill.6) Burnt Ends' Sourdough - Your typical sourdough.Overall the food was nice. Definitely worth a shot but unfortunately I wasn't wow'd by any means. The Sanger was excellent and I'm sure they can make a shop purely from these. I also took a star off because of their lacking dessert and cocktail menus. Not sure if they are hoping people only eat and get out kinda thing but with the kind of setting that they have in there, an awesome cocktail and creative dessert would go long ways to make the place and experience totally memorable.Otherwise, I would recommend you check it out. I know I'll be back to checkout their new menus in the future."

With Australian Chef Dave Pynt on the pass, Burnt Ends have caused quite a stir in the Singapore food scene with their incredible barbeque.During my trip to Singapore, I did not have the intention of visiting this restaurant and therefore did not make any reservations. But when I was looking at Singapore's Burpple Top 100, Burnt Ends was at the top and I just had to give it a try one way or another.With only 17 coveted counter seats, it was quite a challenge to secure a place in their restaurant. So when I tried to make a reservation during the same week, of course they were fully booked. Luckily, there are walk-in options for people that could not get a reservation.When we arrived, we were fortunate enough to snag two seats right at the end of the counter! We were so thrilled to try out what they have to offer.The way Burnt Ends operate differs from other restaurants. Approximately half of the counter seats oversee an open kitchen that is dominated by a four-tonne, dual cavity oven fired by fragrant apple and almond wood. You can also feel the hustling vibe of all the chefs and watch them as they skillfully prepare your food. I wished we were seating there instead. It would have been a totally different dining experience.We were very satisfied with the food as well as their service. Too bad there was only so much we could eat (and limited funds). There was so much more that we wanted to try on their menu - their Squid, Venison, King Crab, Seabass, it all sounds really good! They have clearly mastered their barbecuing technique and their dishes are very affordable. Until this day I am still dreaming about their perfect-rare onglet steak. I look forward to return to Burnt Ends again."

My friend did as well. The queue is fairly long so be prepared to stake it out We both loved the intense beef marmalade. The burnt sanger didn't live up to the hype for either of us. My friend also adored the fennel. I personally felt the fennel flavour was good but the actual fennel didn't have as a strong flavour as expected. I put it down as Singapore not having a great produce selection. The fennel was also a touch over smoked/burnt. The rump steak had an amazingly reduced onion puree. It was a perfectly balanced condiment to the beef. The suckling pig was probably the most underwhelming. The cider reduction was great but there wasn't a lot of it. The skin was nice and crispy. I loved the skin. The pork itself felt a little under seasoned. It was cooked very well but that was all to it. It felt like a slight dissapointment after all the other food we had.I dare say that burnt ends will continue to draw in the crowds!

In a modern and minimal room, most of the seats are on the counter, with a few tables in the back.  The menu follows the current trend where you list only the ingredients.  So for our first course  it was simply listed as leeks, hazelnut, and brown butter.  And sure enough, that's what we got, but it was completely awesome - the leeks were grilled perfectly and sweet and tender, while the hazelnuts provided an excellent counter, and all swimming in a rich yummy bath of brown butter.  The Sanger was also one of the best sandwiches I have had in SG,  It's basically a pulled pork with cole slaw, and aioli which was super messy but on par with some of the better bbq sandwiches I have had back in the States.  The lamb with harissa was good, although my chop was a little grisly.  Do get a steak - even the cheapest version, the Onglet, is very good.  It's basically a hanger steak that is grilled perfectly on the rarer side, with bone marrow and a very rich sauce.  Service is efficient and competent.  My only complaint is that I would not serve a Belgian Abbey ale in a tall glass, but it's a minor issue and one that could be remedied with a wine glass (not perfect but certainly an improvement over a tall glass).    Anyway, DO make a reservation.  The place is small and fills up quickly, even on a Wednesday night.  And definitely try veggies as well as meats, as they handle both deftly here.  And they also have quite a few barrel aged cocktails, which I will definitely have to hit up next time.  The little plates can add up pretty quickly, but it's definitely worth it."

On the day we intended to go we tried 4 times to call for a reservation, but no one ever answered the phone. There is no functioning online reservation either so we had to play by chance by showing up without a reservation. This alone knocks down the rating...even if they are full up for the evening then at least answer the calls to inform patrons.Once we arrived (about an hour after dinner shift started), the place was bumping with people and music. Had a nice trendy vibe and decor and was exactly the type of atmosphere we had expected from the reviews. There were a couple small tables outside (both occupied) and what seemed like no vacancy inside. We asked the hostess if they had an availability for 2? She was helpful and said she'd look around. While waiting we took in some of the ambiance and surveyed the whole restaurant. The floor plan of the dining area was blended tastefully in with the kitchen, very open. The chefs were busily preparing the meals right in front of the customers. When the hostess returned, she mentioned that they only had room at a narrow steel-mesh bar adjacent to the entryway. The mesh bar sat about a foot off the wall and with black painted steel bar stools had about 5 place settings. I'm not a big fan of this type of seating for eating but for a bar it would be ok. This actually is the other reason the rating is knocked down. The mesh bar was too tight and I felt a bit uncomfortable with such little space. I mean if we're gonna drop 150+ on a meal at least design some better seating solutions."

Deeply disappointed. Firstly, no reservations so you have to go and get in by 6pm to try to get on the waiting list. Then you have to scoot off somewhere to have a drink or kill time. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to be seated at the side tables facing the wall. So you can't see any of the kitchen action and they were the most uncomfortable stools and tables. Unbelievable how they maximise space and charge the prices they charge and have such seats. I get it that Singapore space doesn't come cheap but still???Food was unimpressive. We had the smoked quail eggs, cauliflower dukkah (which was the most impressive dish we had that night), onglet steak with marrow, the brioche with bone marrow. The steak did not impress at all and we both felt at the end of the meal that it wasn't worth it at all. Will certainly not go back for another meal. The staff there also weren't helpful and had an attitude."

Eep. Manager says come early, resto opens at 6, and they might be busy from 730, so we made plans to get there EARLY.It's 6.30, and we're pacing our walk to the resto - we didn't want to get there too early, lest we appear too eager... I lie, I really couldn't be bothered about appearing eager. After all, I was showing up on opening night, 30 minutes after they open their doors for service. And we weren't even the first ones there. Oh well. Silly accolade aside, we got down to the menu, and watched the crew work in front of us. Yes, it's one of those counter-seating placers where you get to see everything happen in front of you, and it forces the crew to be ultra clean, and ultra deliberate about every step.Yum points to the warmed oysters abd baby eggplant; the latter blackened to tasty perfection (everyone needs a little char in their lives) and with a touch of sambal on the side (with hae bi!). We also shared the roast suckling pig, which was crazy delicious- crispy crackly skin, with super juicy flesh, and Chef Dave shared that since they didn't want to take away from the pig's natural flavour, he'd let us salt the dish ourselves. Smart man.Dessert was an ice cream sandwich - really, chocolate ice cream between two brownies, and the smoked ice cream with wild hibiscus, which was a very interesting end to the night. Go ahead, imagine smoke, in ice cream, in your mouth. The come here and get all those pre-conceptions blown away."

The Burnt Ends Sanger I think is best described as a friggin delicious twist on the pulled pork sandwich. The Cube Roll steak was also exquisite.

If you're surfing for a place to eat on a Friday date, hurry up and go down now and chope a table (or make a reservation if you can eat at 6.30pm). The service we received however, is what made me dock a star.Let's start with the happy stuff first aka my stomach. We had the fresh pearl oysters to start. That's right, fresh and cold, not warmed (why would you warm these babies?!!). I haven't had such fresh, non-grimey, smooth tasting oysters in my life. I don't know what the chef did while he shucked these babies but man. Oysters!Then we had the grilled courgette show up with the Sanger. Think slices of perfectly grilled courgette with lovely waves of oven hei wafting in your mouth, followed by a thick mild cheese and a puree-ed vegetable 'sauce'. The pulled pork sandwich was tender, sandwiched between a willowy bun made by I'm guessing the stern looking baker lady who paced up and down to the ovens where her sourdoughs were baking. The sandwich was well sauced and had a good dose of cabbage but I *have* to say, the sauce was a little flat. It had some spice and perhaps a mayo base, but  lacked the smoke or sweetness you'd get in the South or at Smokey's in Singapore. Same same but different (interesting) take. Between these dishes and the next 2, we waited more than half an hour before realizing the servers were waiting for us to finish the burger. I was dying from hunger and it was only when I asked the waiter why 1/3 of our table got their food, did we realize there was some systematic course. Given that the menu isn't labeled as such and our host was politely *not* eating his Sanger, I'm going to bluntly say the waiters should have used their brains and asked why our plates weren't moving. Mind you once we figured this out, the kitchen still had to cook our food and we waited another 15 minutes. So the last 2 dishes were the flank steak and the king crab. The flank tends to be a cheap cut, not so much fat, since most cows have well exercised abs. This steak was grilled perfectly medium rare with some bits of fat left on top for good measure. Why would someone torture me like that? The king crab was the weakest part of our meal and word of advice, not the best thing to eat when you're having a business lunch. It wasn't bad per se, but somehow a crab leg with fibrous meat doused with butter and a squeeze of lemon didn't quite knock my socks off (now the shrimp at Blu however...).All round great food. The open kitchen is also hugely entertaining, especially when a table sent back their steak because someone messed up. Think Gordon Ramsay action without the f words yelled out loud. I saw one sous chef taste off a common spoon after putting the finishes to a plate, and place the spoon back in the common utensil basket. I squirmed for a second, but since it wasn't my dish up next, got over it. So yes, don't expect intelligent service and you'll have to push them abit if you're on work time. Otherwise, the food coming out of the kitchen is amazeballs."

You wouldn't expect barbecued fare to be this polished, but Burnt Ends' mastery of the grill is inimitable. Prices are a little steep, considering the tapas portions of most dishes, but well worth it.Service was extraneously amiable and chipper in attitude, as Burnt Ends doesn't charge for service. And because the menu was impossibly succinct, scant almost, the staff's fair grasp of the menu helped inform our choices.We had:1) Smoked Quail Egg ($15 each) - topped with caviar: the minuscule mouthful costs a pretty penny, but wow was this glorious. I finally get why caviar is prized as a delicacy. These inky black pearls lent a plush briny counterpoint to the nuanced smokiness of the perfectly soft quail's egg. An absolute can't miss. 2) Tomato Toast & Lardo ($18): looked rustic but was exquisite. The blobs of tomatoes, lightly torched on the grill, were bursting with an incredible sweetness.3) Beef and Mustard ($18): my favourite version of beef tartare ever. It was clear and refreshing, the bite of the mustard restrained the rounded body of the beef.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20) with pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw, chipotle aioli, and melty cheese sandwiched between a pillowy sesame seeded brioche bun: TO-DIE-FOR.

So good. I practically loved every single dish we got. I had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times... and I finally did! :D so without further ado, here's what we had:Smoked quail eggs white truffle - it's good, but for the price of $12 PER EGGS i wouldn't get it again. i thought they'd at least give 2-3 eggs for that price, but no. it was really $12 for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle - yummy, but not worth the price tag!Squid, sweet corn and paprika sauce - this is an excellent dish. i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was, and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce. even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish (but I ate anyway) was tasty as hell.Onglet, onion and bone marrow - soOooO sooooo good. the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked, but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i didn't pay too much attention. they didn't bother asking us how we'd like it done, but it came out just perfect. the meat was perfectly seared on the outside, and so juicy and so pink-tender on the inside.Burnt End's Sanger (pulled pork burger) - ok, could you tell I saved the best for last? cause I totally did. this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison. and then we got seconds - it was THAT GOOD.Banana with Caramel - this was a lovely dessert, though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger - i felt like it really stole the show for me....anyway, i digress. the banana was nicely done and flavorful, though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert. thankfully it wasn't massive or anything, so we didn't struggle with it.Totally would come back here again - there were many dishes that caught my eye that I just didn't have the stomach space to try.Update (Feb 5): went back and had the following dishes:- uni with cauliflower sauce- leeks, hazelnut- corgette- toast and tomato with pancetta- sanger- flank, onion and marrow- banana caramelWill update properly when i have the chance."

I used modern because I am lax to use fusion - which often has negative connotation - this place serves up what I think is a very contemporary style of food: it straddles both eastern and weatern flavors perfectly well, and meshes elements and techniques to a cohesive and (if done right) enjoyable result.n.b. if you know a less rambling way to descibe that manner of cooking, I'd be well-pleased to hear it.competitively priced, enjoyable food with some standouts, a lovely restaurant and kitchen theatrics on show, this is my thursday recommendation for friday (or any day) date night.we were on a gander through keong saik friday night when we decided to pop in and try our luck - the first to arrive on the tail of someone's canceled reservation, so we scored a seat at the counter. it's a lovely space - intimate and exclusive. there's also something infinitely pleasing about watching your food being prepared before you.we started with the truffled quail eggs - really just soft-centred boiled eggs sprinkled with tiny truffle shavings and salt: alright, though nothing particularly alluring. the sea urchin atop cauliflower mousse was quite tasty - rich, soft uni atop the mousse, with tiny pearl-type seaweed for contrasting texture. the salmon roe atop crispy fish skin was more in line with what I expected from this place - the best way to eat this is to smear the eggs evenly atop the surface, so you get a bit of salty fishiness in each bite - pretty delicious. the mains here are expertly executed - it has a lot to do with that large oven (and grill ) they operate - the food comes full of delicious smoky flavor, perfectly cooked and tender inside, but with a delicious maillard-ed crust outside. take the fish collar - I forget the species - a large white with a blackened crust, cooked flaky and tender, juicy inside and well-seasoned; and well-complemented by the crunchy mixed seaweed. the onglet was similarly impressive - marbled beef in a dark jus, topped with sliced bits of marrow. that marrow was meltingly soft and heart-stoppingly (perhaps literally) rich; and you don't get to specify the doneness of the beef here, but it's no matter - it came pink and tender and beefy.\and we finished with dessert: the recommendation of the warm apple was sweet, dark pieces of cooked fruit below a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with nuts. so comforting and delicious - a bit like grandma's dessert grown up.the food was of a consistently high standard (which might or might not be attributed to its pedigree), and it was well pleasing (especially for a restaurant that serves modern cuisine) that portions were fair and satisfying and prices actually reasonable. well-recommended, and a star amongst the new establishements. reminds me a little of the market grill - though this place is a little more sophisticated.p.s. they serve a suckling pig! up for advance order, and someone must have, because I saw the pig (not metaphorical) at the back. I think it's worth an order, because they hack it up and throw it on that impressive grill before serving - which must make for some deliciously charred skin and meltingly soft meat."

Walking in, I felt like I was walking straight into a well organized barbeque party as opposed to a regular restaurant. This takes the open kitchen concept to a totally different level. The oven and open grills are directly in the line of sight (really, the focal piece) of the diners. It really takes you right into the heat of the action, pun intended. We ordered the following:- smoked quail eggs: This was a wonderful starter and had a deep, smokey flavour. The eggs had an almost translucent, jelly-like exterior and a runny yolk. Loved the unexpected smokiness of the eggs. A nice introduction to the running ""smoke shack"" theme of the restaurant.- squid, sweet corn and mild paprika: the squid was sweet and succulent. Loved the flavours and the crunchiness of the corn against the soft flesh of the squid. Enjoyed the plating, with the wild pop of colours. - fennel, burrata and orange oil: very interesting to watch the blackened fennel come out of the oven. It was completely ""burnt"". Sous chef will slice the fennel in front of you, revealing the perfectly grilled fennel inside. - onglet, burnt onion and marrow: the star of the show. the piece de resistence. The sear on the steak was perfect and crisp and so tender insider. It was charred to smokey perfection and tasted amazing. The natural flavours really came through; delicious.- butterhead lettuce, shallots and vinaigrette: don't belittle this side dish and do yourself a favour and order this! I enjoyed this very much as it was possibly the only dish that was not grilled or placed in the oven (or was I wrong?). The very fresh, cold and crisp lettuce provided the perfect complement to the grilled and heavier dishes. I'd say that it's an essential order and really helps to balance out the oil and fat of the other dishes. - banana and caramel: this was a small banana burnt on the outside and caramel ice-cream on the side. A smokey and sweet ending to the meal. The meal went full circle, starting out with an unexpected dish of smoked quail eggs and ending off with a grilled banana. I liked how the smoked theme played throughout the entire dinner and this really did justice to the restaurant's name.It was also much fun watching the Chef David and his crew in action and feeling like you're part of the action in the kitchen.  I thought it was genius that the kitchen did not require any frying. Everything was done on the grill and in the oven. That's altogether brilliant and daring. We arrived on a Thursday evening at around 7 pm. No queues then and we were seated straight away. Service was good too. Overall, an enjoyable evening, albeit a smokey one as we came home smelling like barbeque which was of course to be expected!"

We started with the crackling and mustard, which is pretty much pork rinds with a mustard dip. I wasn't too impressed with it, except that the mustard was pretty good. Plus the fact that I saw them pull out the crackings from a tupperware, and it was served cold. Would have been much better if it was freshly fried. We had the sea urchin with cauliflower, which was 10 bucks a spoon. The uni was relatively fresh, and I liked how the black garlic and caulifllower puree complemented the sweetness of it, but it wasn't overwhelming good and didn't think it was worth the price tag. The grilled kingfish collar was as good as grilled kingfish kama gets, and I liked the green apple slaw that came with it. The pulled pork slaw burger was probably the best dish of all, with the juicy shaved pork and pickled slaw served with a hot brioche bun, albeit a tad heavy. I guess I came with great expectations, and I felt that it didn't deliver."

Here I was, a week later... and what a culinary adventure!This is not your traditional Peranakan restaurant. Candlenut features many familiar ingredients that the Straits Chinese use, but it has creatively tweaked some recipes and on occasion created something new, the Buah Keluak ice cream for one. Having a non-discriminatory palate (and an open mind) is really the best way to make the most of your experience here.We went for the cheekily named 'ah-ma-kase' set menu which came with three appetisers, soup, salad and a selection of main courses. For appetisers, we had the Smoked Octopus Acar (spicy pickle), Kurobuta Pork Satay (tender, perfectly grilled, hints of paprika, accompanied by a sweet sauce), and the exceptionally delectable Kueh Pie Tee (wafer thin crispy shells filled with tasty crabmeat, subtle hints of lemongrass).Appetisers were quickly followed by Itek Tim, a savoury-sourish duck soup. Candlenut offered an interesting twist, adding spongelike taro stem to the soup and having the duck meat served as a meatball with minced mushrooms and pickled mustard cabbage.The main courses which came in generous portions, were served communal style. Mom's Curry Prawns was my favorite - giant prawns were first lightly grilled then cooked in a delicious lemongrass candlenut curry gravy. Grilled Red Snapper (drizzled with lime juice, lemongrass-onion-chilli sauce) was another outstanding dish. Duck Curry, aromatic from various ground spices, was cooked in a rendang style with the coconut curry thick and creamy. Wok-fried Pork Slices was another winner. Sautéed with prawn chilli sambal and shredded kaffir lime leaves, it delivered a remarkably fiery punch, punctuated by the distinctive citrusy notes of the lime leaves. Prawn Wing Bean Salad offered a refreshing light contrast to the other main dishes but as this was nearly the only greens in the set, I would have loved for it to come in a bigger serving. After a complimentary palate cleanser - lemongrass granita, we moved on to desserts. The Mao Shan Wang Durian Ice Cream was every bit as mouthwatering as its pedigree would have you anticipate. It was also a pretty scoop adorned with flowers and a rose cookie. Steamed Banana Cake was light and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the accompanying Gula Melaka ice cream. However the star in this section belonged to the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Savoury bits of the distinctive earthly nut were mixed into the ice cream and there was also the delightful crunch of salted caramel. What a brilliant combination of flavours and textures.Traditional Peranakan cuisine will always be a part of Singapore's food culture. Notwithstanding, I applaud Candlenut's creative flair, and courage in pushing boundaries, and for its ambition to elevate Peranakan cuisine to levels of fine dining. Afterall didn't Peranakan cuisine evolve from an innovative fusion of cooking techniques and ingredients of 2 or more distinct cultures, necessitated in part by a need to adapt? Kudos, Chef Lee and his team."

The food is uniquely Singaporean, the joining of Chinese and Malay food using the local ingredients.The dining space, part of a large warehouse, does not at all resemble a Michelin restaurant however, the food speaks for itself.Begin with a number of small plates. All dishes are meant to be shared. The kueh pie tee crispy shell stuffed with crab meat, seasoned with curry, and a bit of pickled shallots, almost taste of laksa.  The wing bean salad with baby radish, lemongrass, cashews in a calimansi lime dressing, the definition of texture. Extremely refreshing. Finally the crispy pork belly with pickled greens, outstanding. Think of the best Filipino lechon topped with crisp pickled veg, it's tight sour grip finishing with a gentle fermented seafood flavor. Excellent complexity.Mains crisscross the country. An excellent wagyu beef rendang, tender and extremely flavorful wrapped in a slury of cumin, turmeric, turmeric leaves, and other spices, wallops the pallet. The spice mix penetrates the meat all the way to its deep core. Not to be out done, a dish called ""Mum's Curry"" is equally deeply flavored. Tender, juicy chunks of chicken and potatoes and a deep rich curry mixture. Fresh peppers brighten the dish. Both are perfect spooned over some rice.The dish of the evening, red lion snapper simply cooked in a fresh chili sambal with charred garlic chives; incredible. The sweet flavor of the fish is accented beautifully by the fiery sambal.  A squeeze of calamansi brightens the flavor. Desserts, are also outstanding. It is hard to fault the Kueh salat with bangkit crumble and young coconut sorbet.  Hawaii yeeps, think of the best custard mochi you've ever had, add a light, refreshing, coconut supercharged sorbet and you have this dish.Service is informal and very friendly. As with most South East Asian countries, you must flag the server if you want something.Nice selection of wine however there is no better match to the food than beer considering the spice levels.Reservations required.Impressive to say the least. Save this for your final meal in the country and it will all make sense.Thank you Singapore."

Ambience is nice... the place is done up really nicely decor-wise and it felt quite sophisticated yet traditional. There were 6 of us so we ordered a good variety of dishes to share. My favorite dish was the charcoal grilled whole squid with fresh yellow tumeric sambal - really tender and fragrant, and was complemented well with the sambal, which was very flavorful. I'd also recommend the babi pongteh (braised duroc pork cheek pongteh) which was super tender. The ayam buah keluak was tasty too though I wish they left the whole nut inside for the experience... The one thing I wished though was if the server had asked us if we wanted to have a portion of the homemade sambal belachan to try - $2 per sharing portion. I mean... yes it's on the menu, and I don't agree with having to pay for it, but the point is that they didn't even ask... and I found the food not spicy enough.. it's a peranakan restaurant after all right?Dessert was expensive and absolutely nothing to shout about. I'd give it a miss if I find myself back there. Overall, not too bad ""refined"" peranakan food but I think you can find better elsewhere for cheaper and with more character."

I was glad to have found just one Michelin restaurant with Singaporean roots. I honestly must say, I was disappointed. Singaporean food, boasting strong flavors and rich spices, was not accurately reflected in the meal I had.The jackfruit curry was mild in flavor, without the strong spice flavors.The sambal was very tender, but the meat was quite shredded and the flavor, again, not as strong as the rich street foods we had tried.Singaporean food all should have strong enough flavors that require it to be paired with rice, but my rice bowl was still near full. Some advice for visitors: although Singapore may have the most number of Michelin Starred restaurants, if you want a local Singaporean experience, stick with the food markets and the local restaurants to truly get the Singaporean eating experience."

Since this is a fusion restaurant, I did not have high hopes, in spite of them having won a Michelin star. The restaurant decor is sparse but pleasant. Service was very attentive and really friendly. 5 stars. They had a regular menu you would expect from this type of restaurant, but with twists to the traditional recipes.  For example, the ayam buah  keluak had decent flavor but the emphasis was the chicken, whereas traditional food is the opposite. Likewise the prawn petai, flavors were there, but the emphasis was the fresh prawns, not the petai. All in all the food was decent, but not spectacular.  If you are expecting authentic peranakan, you will be disappointed. However they were true to their advertisement, fusion peranakan. A downside was the pricing, quite expensive, about $70 per person."

Setting is more of a casual establishment, staffs are pretty friendly. The food:Ocean trout as appetizer - love the combination of tangy buttermilk, with a hint of yuzu. $22Rangers valley ribeye- thick meat, excellent marbling, well seasoned, simple and tasty especially with a dash of soy sauce. $55Barramundi with leek, bonito butter & caramelized onion - love this dish a lot too specifically both the butter and onion, they get along perfectly like bonnie & clyde. $32Rhubard with ginger caramel, lingonberry ice cream & roasted white chocolate - now this is mind blowing and this is coming from a person who doesn't really like desserts in general. This dessert is so creative, so delicious, such an excellent creation. We had to order this 3x because it's SO GOOD. It really is my kinda dessert. $15At least I know now where to get my dessert when the sugar craving strikes once a month. On an unrelated note, I personally don't like the presence of fans there, annoyingly disturbing and unnecessary. The aircons were blowing so strongly as well and in a weird way.

The food-sphere celebrity endorsements, the comments from my friends and coworkers, I expected my meal here to blow me away. I expected to stand up to Humpback, slap it in the face, and wrest my heart away with aplomb. Long story short, the meal was... above average but not unspectacular, and my favourite (not-ridiculously) expensive restaurant of the moment remains Humpback. But enough about Humpback; what went right and what went wrong and what went eh maybe at CbJ?Positive highlights: the Ocean Trout. The trout was delicious. Well executed, the flavours were fairly delicate, not in your face. It was a dish I'd order again, but not unique or novel enough that it's ""worth coming back for"". The much heralded confit duck with waffles... this dish. Wow. That five-spice caramel. The cucumber and mint salad on the side. This dish isn't a ""fine dining plate"" where you eat all the components together. This was an elevated chicken and waffles, fatty and sweet and rich and delicious, and the salad on the side is so you can refresh your palate and keep going. It's not a subtle dish by any means, it's a kick the door down and go HEY THE FLAVOUR IS HERE GUYS GUNS BLAZING dish, and while that might not be for everyone, it was possibly the saving grace for the evening for us.The black olive cake drew mixed reviews, but since this is my Yelp account, I'm going to say I loved it. It was clever. A brownie-looking cake that was slightly savoury, crumble that wasn't crumble (caramelised white chocolate crumbs) cream that wasn't cream (yogurt)... it was a dish of diverse elements, and as a slightly savoury dessert, my favourite kind.Oh shout-out to the padron peppers and hasselback potatoes. Solid small plates, those I'd order again without hesitation. Definite no-nos: Really, only the venison. Served under cucumber (or was it zucchini), with wasabi and fermented? Pickled? Plum, the plum destroyed the dish. A tart, acidic sauce like an inverse version of the plum sauce you see with roast meat at Cantonese restaurants, this tart gelee overpowered everything. All you could taste was SOUR. No matter what you ate off the plate, if you didn't first scrape off that dastardly gel, all it would be was SOUR. Urgh. I grimace just thinking of it.Everything else was... good. Not knock-it-out of the park good, but good. The slow roasted beetroot was excellent, right up there with most renditions I've had, but beetroot and goats cheese isn't rocket science, and it was served with puffed rice that had a granularity to it akin to sand. Not all of it was bad, but I had some mouthfuls were I was worried I'd chip a tooth, or felt like I was chewing on... sand. Yes. The Roasted Pumpkin? Just toooo many things going on the plate. Pumpkin. Nuts. Cream. And a relish? Wow. Just tooooo many things there guys. The Wagyu steak? A touch overdone when they seared it after the sous-vide (we're guessing they did a sous vide, the amount of unrended fat and perfect interior was unreal), the bottom and edges of the steak were effectively well done. Practically crisp.  Service was good. Friendly, eager, but not perfect. There were minor slip ups here and there, like offering dessert when we still had a main yet to arrive, putting a wine glass on our table when we hadn't ordered anything yet... but then even though we order the potatoes seconds before our main arrived at the table, it still arrived in time to accompany most of it because the kitchen clearly rushed it for us.All in all, Cheek by Jowl has some things going for it (the service team really is quite good, bar the minor not-critical mistakes), and I think the restaurant can only go up. Would I go back? Yeah if someone told me they wanted to. Would I opt to go back again on my own? Not at this point no."

It literally combines the two best things together: dim sum and buffet. Hubby was so excited for it and we even arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened for trading. We went for the first seating that started at 11 AM.The restaurant was quite grandeur and calm at the same time. The dark wooden furniture gave a very classy feel to the whole restaurant. Hubby and I were used to the bustling dim sum carts and noisy tables. I think it was quite calm because there were only a few people that morning. We quite enjoyed the warm and luxurious atmosphere at Cherry Garden. Yes, there wasn't any dim sum carts rolling around the place that morning. We ordered what we wanted off the buffet menu through the friendly staff. Our tea pot always got refilled promptly by them too. The menu also consists of soup & appetisers, desserts and other hot Chinese dishes (rice, congee, noodles, seafood, meat, vegetables).We started off with something light so we ordered the rice congee and a serving of hot and sour soup. The rice congee came with the century egg and shredded pork while the hot and sour soup contained a good amount of seafood in it. Both items look small in the photo but the size of the serving bowl was actually really good. We really enjoyed our deep fried Chinese-bun that came with chilli crab meat sauce. It was so yummy and if there wasn't any time limit on the buffet I'd just sit there and keep on ordering this dish (heheh).We ordered quite a few dishes from the dim sum selection such as chicken feet in black bean sauce, pork siew mai with baby abalone, juicy pork xiao long bao, and the yummy deep-fried escargot dumplings. I never seen or heard of any escargot dumplings before so we decided to order it. It was a sweet and creamy surprise! The Kurobuta char siew bao had a really fluffy exterior and juicy sweet meats on the inside.We really liked how the serving is suited for the number of people in your group. As it was only me and hubby, they gave us a small serving of the braised beef fillet. The beef was really tender and juicy.We really enjoyed our brunch at Cherry Garden and looking forward to go back there again next time we're in Singapore. The dim sum costs SGD $68 per person and there are two seatings available: 11 AM to 1 PM or 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. It's definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion as well although you might want to book in advance for weekend or public holiday seating."

FOOD - We did not select one of their pre-fixe menus, but instead opted for ordering multiple family-style items as suggested by our waiter. We ordered the Peking duck, scallops, pan seared chicken, fried rice, and wasabi prawns. The food was mediocre at best, aside from the Peking duck - which was quite delicious and I would come back for only that. The other items were nothing special, and certainly not ""Michelin-Star"" quality in our opinion (and we're experienced Michelin Star diners).SERVICE - What a disappointment! For this caliber of a restaurant we were extremely dissatisfied with the waitstaff.  While our courses came out promptly, our table was constantly left with dirty plates for sometimes up to 10 minutes after we had finished eating. Disgusting. We also ended up pouring our own wine several times since the servers did not seem to notice our empty glasses despite how many times they walked by. Unacceptable. The waitstaff was nice but very inattentive to us even though the restaurant was not that busy and we were seated next to the hosts stand. This was another annoyance in itself. Upon arriving we were seated at the table right next to the host stand and entrance - in other words, the worst table in the house. It had no atmosphere and it barely even felt like we were dining in the restaurant. Considering it was 7:45 and the restaurant was less than half full, we requested a different table but were told ""they were completely booked"". By the end of our meal, the restaurant had only became more empty, and there were PLENTY of open tables, so this was quite annoying. Our experience was so disappointing overall we skipped desert and opted to leave early. For a Michelin-Starred restaurant, they have A LOT of areas to be improved."

They really commit to delivering excellent service and deserve due recognition.I enjoyed dinner more than the brunch buffet, mainly because the star of the buffet, the dim sum, was more lose-sum than win-sum.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of variety, and some very unique selections. The custard bun with chocolate was to me, just delicious. Not too sweet, super rich chocolate filling that other people at the table made rather unflattering analogies with, I was more than happy to eat two.The cooked items such as the pork, duck, and other seafood items and meat were definitely of an excellent standard, and probably stole the show. It's only a pity that there's a limit on how many of certain items you can order because they cost more.The soups were... alright. I wouldn't describe them as bland, but they weren't any better than something you'd order at Soup Restaurant. Overall, while the value for the buffet brunch is undeniable (particularly if you're a bottomless pit comme moi), but I think the quality of the dinner menu is far superior. A good compromise? Go for the buffet, but aim for the cooked items. That's where all the delicious lurks."

Oh yeah, the endless buffets. It's only fitting I post a SG review for a Chinese buffet... it harkens back to the good ole days of yore, when I willingly posted about my piggy-ventures on the east coast. But the difference lies in the standards of this a la carte buffet of Cherry Garden. This place is good. And by good, I mean goooooooood. Order as many of those little juicy bite-size delicacies of dim sum as you want, and it arrives steaming hot ready to be scooped up and chomped on. Shrimp fillings are surprisingly plump and springy, and the dumpling skin is not too thick (okay, not super thin, but willing to overlook this small fact). If an overload of dumplings isn't enough to satisfy your weekend hangover, top it up with a choice of soup, meat, fish and vegetable dishes-- and even dessert! (I recommend the refreshing watermelon aloe dessert in all its liquid nitrogen foggy goodness). Does this food far exceed any Chinese buffet I've ever experienced back home? Um, yes.The price is only marginally more than you would pay for any normal dim sum excursion, so is it worth it? Um, yes. Have I gone more times than I can possibly admit on a public forum and not seem ridiculous? Um, yes."

I will admit that I feel as if the standard has dropped a little since I first came here. But it's still the best dim sum I've ever had in Singapore.Their dim sum brunch deal is good value for all you can eat. There are a few mis-steps, eg. the skin on the har gau is too thick, the fried tentacles are bland and the hot & sour soup also lacks punch.But there are also a lot of hits.

And this time round I was here on a weekday morning in Toa Payoh for a plate of so called one of the best carrot cake in Singapore. In the past I was there in the evening and was rather disappointed as by the time I was there, Chey Sua Carrot Cake Stall was already closed for the business day.There was no queue in front of the stall which caught me by surprised and immediately i went up and order a medium portion at $3 but was asked for a table number. They provide the service to your table and no wonder there was no queue to be seen.They are one of the few carrot cakes stall left that insist in preparing their own carrot cake from the scratch instead of adopting the factory packed carrot cake. And if you are looking for traditional taste like this, Chey Sua Carrot Cake may suits the list.Carrot Cake - $3 (Medium)Though most of the Carrot Cake comes in white or Black version, for Chey Sua, their default will be white. I was absolutely surprise when the lady took my order over. Carrot cake was fried to crisp and you can see the distinctively layer and amount of eggs used. The combination of crispiness and softness of their carrot cake was heavenly. Not forgetting about the consistent use of chai bor that had been mixed with the carrot cake, elevating its taste. Unlike the usual carrot cakes we had in rectangular and cube shapes, theirs remind me of Korean Kimchi Pancake.Spelling another difference in their carrot cake will be the style of chilli used. If you realised, chilli was only a final touchup on the exterior crisp layer. The uniqueness of Chey Sua Carrot Cake had really won my heart! I don't mind travelling here in the morning for a plate of this again!"

There's quite a bit of hype over it and when my nomming friend mentioned that you had to wait in excess of 30mins for this dish - I was kind of expecting something a lot more, flavourful. So, wait we did - and my friend who lives around the area has been to this hawker centre multiple times but only had this carrot cake once because of the extremely long wait time, that I guess is a deterrent to some. As we waited, we ordered other dishes and the friend shared that, it's really up to the stall owners when you're going to get your carrot cake and that a lot of people give up after a while. So when the carrot cake came, I really was expecting something yummy for all that hype and wait that you have to go through. But, it really disappointed. The only thing that I liked about it was the crispy eggy top - which was its saving grace. I wasn't too excited about the flour kuehs below because it was really too salty and chopped up. I'm more a fan of carrot cake that has rice kuehs that you can bit into and have that smokey wok hei flavor just burst in your mouth. Overall, I wouldn't wait for this carrot cake again.

My favorite stall used to be from the market somewhere in Ang Mo Kio where it was fried by a very old auntie (probably in her 70s) in the 2000s. The kueh (steamed carrot cake) was homemade and was the same for the chwee kueh also sold in the stall. It was wobbly soft and could just melt in your mouth. I have yet to taste something similar ever since. The kueh in most fried carrot cake was firm or hard, like days old kueh. It just was not satisfying.Chey Sua Carrot Cake almost got the wobbly soft texture. What I like about it was the crispy eggy part which covered the soft kueh underneath. The chili was even distributed and fried together. I really dislike those places where the chili was served on the side. The wait was long, maybe 30 minutes or more, during lunch time. And it was sold out by 2pm that day. Go early and order. While waiting for it, order something else to tide you over, and the carrot cake can be a snack to share when it arrives.

Similar to Come Daily Hokkien Mee at the same food centre, I have practically grew up with both stalls. And over the years, I also watched the older generation pass the baton on to their younger generation. Fortunately, standards have not dropped one bit.A good carrot cake to me is a combination of fresh home made carrot cake, eggs and chye poh (pickled radish). Like any other good stall, Chey Sua still makes their own carrot cake. You can see them being portioned out of small aluminium bowls which they have been using since they first opened. What I particularly like about their carrot cake is one side is fried practically to a crisp while the other side is only lightly fried. So what you get is a crispy surface and white carrot cake all the way through. The portion of eggs is generous and the chye poh is just right, not too salty. And of course the chilli is just nice too, not too overpowering or oily. They are opened from 6am till 1pm everyday except on Mondays. Perfect for a weekend breakfast."

I tried their standard duck rice and I gotta say I like it over many other duck rice stalls in Singapore. They definitely aren't the average joe duck rice stalls. The rice is pretty well done too, but the best was still the lean duck meat. The chili sauce was so-so, not a big factor that makes them popular.

Man, was it good! I've never looked back since that first time, there's never been another, never will. Like I say, this is the best Hokkien mee. Ever. I am not going to describe the dish for you, there is no need to. Just go try it. Not anywhere, but here at Tian Tian Lai Hokkien Mee. Tell me if you don't agree. Tell me if you do."

It has been extremely hard to find really delicious noodles now, what with so many hawkers retiring and food court versions being generic. This is a calorie laden dish with each strand of noodle (mee and bee hoon) being coated with the addictive rich lardy sauce. There I said it. Lard. The lard made all the difference. Besides a few pieces of lard being served with the noodles, the whole dish has the taste of lard and prawn. It has been at least a year or more since I last went there and the standard is still good. Price seemed to have increased, but for the $4 plate (small), it seemed to be more than before. What I found is that while it is really yummy, too much of a good thing can be bad for you. Literally. It does get a bit ""jelak"" (so rich you get sick of it) after a while. So either just have a small portion or share the bigger plate."

They have been around since the early 70s. Back then, they were in located along Toa Payoh Lorong 1 in a small row of food shophouses facing the road. You could always see the snaking lunch crowds and dinner queues.  When the nearby wet market was redeveloped and the shophouses torn down, their stall moved to the 2nd level food centre above the new market. Fortunately, their standards have remained high despite the generations. And the snaking queues remain.Theirs is the wet and gooey version of this perennial hawker favourite. I feel it brings out the full flavor of the stock, the prawns, the squids, the pork bellies, and of course the noodles. It is also one of the few stalls I have been lucky enough to enjoy since I was a wee lad. And hopefully, for many many more years to come."

The restaurant itself is within Singapore Botanical Gardens, but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting, there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to Corner House without much trouble. Once there, you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area. There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself. One of the standouts for sure, alongside the decor, is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular - it has the feeling of a high-end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing (thanks to the temperature here, no one shows up in the more formal dress I would expect to see at a European or American Michelin-starred restaurant), but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident. Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good. As for service, I found it a bit more attentive than Candlenut (from the previous night), but in a similar fashion, it was not overly personalized either.In a similar vein, what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got - no deviation or extra surprises along the way. While there are other menu options if you don't come over the weekend, you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise (we were there Sunday). You get 9 courses, but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours, so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than I was expecting to have. That said, I felt that every dish was very strong as a result - it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible. The amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion - our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble. My favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented, which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime-infused broth - simple and refreshing. We moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared. The scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice, and combined with the yuzu, was fresh, and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta - making it a bit of an Italian-inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce. The white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal - the only vegetarian course outside of dessert - but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective. The highlight was definitely the blue cod, which was served with the scales of the skin crisped, mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin...definitely one of the most beautiful-looking fish dishes I have eaten (and gorgeously presented to boot). The wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate, but it was quite delicious (although it could have been cooked a tad more - the middle was too rare for my liking). We finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of French strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser / first dessert, followed by a chocolate mousse served with Earl Grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates - probably the heaviest dish of evening, but a nice way to end the meal sated.Corner House is a more Western-oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast Asian cuisine, but even if you have limited time here, it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot. To me, it feels like an appropriate representation of what Singapore has become, and it's worth making the trek out from the city center (about a 15-20 minute drive) to dine here."

Impeccable service - my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four.The Salted Egg Macaroons. My god. These might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. They melt on your tongue, leaving a cacophony of flavour. If there's a peak for Singapore's salted egg obsession, this is it.But truth be told - the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting. The asparagus was quite plain. The gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours. The crispy cod, though, was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting. The venue is beautiful, and the service impeccable. Even if dinner (plus three house wines between four) cost a hefty $400 sgd, it was an evening to remember."

Long review:Food is creative but not exhilarating. Ambiance is typical and very short of special. Hype is overwhelming with Michelin accolades and table scarcity. You can spend $300pp much more wisely than eating here. Biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast (no photo pictures because of this), lack of intimacy (group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding, which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner), overall casual atmosphere (T-shirt's and crocs allowed).I would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center. Don't  bother dressing nicely, because you will certainly be overdressed. With that in mind, this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion.

Highly recommended in every regard - setting, service, food, and creativity. My girlfriend and I made a Sunday dinner reservation where, quite frankly, I was expecting a typical French fusion restaurant that I see all over NYC, London, etc but there has to be a reason that it is Top 50 in Asia (even though the list is totally hit or miss). We arrived at the drop off location (after a short period of getting lost - Make sure you go to the Nassim Gate location which is at Nassim Road and Cluny Road. Google Maps took us to the other side of the Botanic Gardens at Corner House Gate which is the service entrance), pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant.We sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu. We opted for the dinner Discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned 8 course experience (see image). Afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely French heavy and what I thought was a very expensive list. We did a nice bottle of Hermitage.I LOVE restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot. Every menu option was just...WOW. Not a single course that wasn't to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each. The specific items that blew my mind were the ""Interpretation of my favorite vegetables"" which was a few different snacks using onion, each of which were surprisingly fantastic. Would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing? IT WAS!! Or onion with truffle or dried onion slices? SO GOOD!! Also was the ""Chef Jason's botanica"" which was simply an art piece. Should be in a museum somewhere. Lastly was his ""My favorite childhood food memory"" dessert with meringue crackers, homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread - which was totally out of this world. Anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking, I get happy.Service was impeccable. The waiters were all very kind and friendly, not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber. To add the final touch of perfection, Jason Tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit. Easily part of the top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Asia. Highly recommend if on a date with someone special (you are in the Singapore Botanic Gardens after all), a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together!"

A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour. We were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs. We were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served. That's the whole service I give honor to as I care extensively about what I eat and how they flavored my dining exposure.They came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out. I was look forward to the small heap of Yves Bordier French butter - very rich and creamy. Like we did, sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon appétit!We were presented with the Marinated Norwegian Salmon Trout for a start. I am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat. Nevertheless, the teaser wasn't a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions, celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth. The salmon is nice without a fishy note, very nicely cured.I had the free range chicken instead of the Riso Pasta (supplement of $8), the latter reminds me of Orzo pasta which I once had at The Waterfall Cafe and am still liking it. I didn't want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me. The Free Range Chicken has a very fine texture, baby tender like a juvenile. The skin is lightly pan-seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out. Jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness. The foam like I guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate.I tasted the impressive ""The interpretation of Kaya Toast"" (supplement of $8) and was feeling complete! The taste of Gula Melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding. I love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar, mirroring the chendol we once knew. The muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet - heavenly match.Alternatively, you may choose to go with the Soursoup Sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast. It has a smooth texture with a robust Soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication. Not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of Morello cherry compote. The pretty-looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction. It gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal. However if you adore a loud booming ending, go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me.Oh they have free buggy service, ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden.Bon appetit, yelpers!!!"

As expected its pricy. Perfect for that special occasion. Very romantic. A great place for couples to pop the question. The chicken was one of their signature dishes. Deceptively simple but the breast was brined and sous verde. The cooking and preparation method ensured that it was tender and succulent with the brine intensifying the flavor. The dark meat was brined and pan fried. 2 methods, very different and went well in contrast."

Food proved excellent - good variety of flavors and combination of tastes - and met my expectations based on my experience with Au Jardin. The style is listed as ""modern European"" on this website, but the waiter pointed out local influences, so it was more like contemporary fusion. The pork jowl was exceptional. The only thing that might do with improvement was what seemed to me the overuse of mousse-type sauces and creams. As for service, a couple of the wait staff were excellent but a couple of others looked grumpy (one made eye contact with me several times and just stared with no hint of a smile). I also had to ask for my water glass to be refilled midway through the meal. No one asked if we'd like coffee/tea afterwards. Unfortunate that the service overall did not match the outstanding food."

Both of us had the tempura soft shelled crab which was beautifully  cooked and presented. The cod was perfectly cooked (extremely fresh and moist).  My braised beef cheek was so tender it was almost unnecessary to have a knife, and was delicious. Desserts were both excellent.  One of the best lunches we have ever had.  Portions are not large but adequate.  Reviews are correct about the price. Three course for $S 42, but my wife upgraded the entree to Atlantic Cod for$8 and dessert to Kaya Toast for $9.  I upgraded to braised beef cheeks for $12 and vacherin goma (black and white sesame ice cream) for $5. But still worth the price due to extremely good food and service.  We met Chef Tan who came to see how we liked the meal.  He took pictures with us and even showed us his kitchen since I said I am a foodie.

In this establishment you are to experience traditional dim sum perfected and refined to fit a high-class dining experience. I think at least, I've barely eaten anything.As I write this we're about 40 minutes into service and have received only 2 of 8 dishes that we had ordered. They did let us know upon entering that we would only have 1 hour since we didn't have a reservation, which is fine, dim sum barely takes any time at all! Come to find that again, each dish is taking rather long and tables around us are being fed multiple dishes before we've received our 3rd. We've gotten LOADS of tea though, they are very good at pouring and restocking our tea. Which is all we've been doing because there's nothing else to consume on this table.The dishes we did have are fine. They're fine. Worth the 40 minute wait? I'm going to have to reserve judgment since I've yet to taste our remaining 6 items.Our waitress let us know that there were complications in the kitchen, but I find that extremely hard to believe when most other tables have been served many plates of food and we are the only table that has been neglected. The only redeeming factor about this experience is that I ate beforehand. Despite that, this wait is inexcusable and I would exercise caution when dining with Crystal Jade.Update: We've finally received all of our food in exactly 1 hour. I can't imagine that they'd give us grief about staying here longer because we need to eat. My final judgment- it's fine. I can't imagine myself wanting this again or wanting to recommend it to friends. So as there is nothing exceptional being served here, I would only dine here if it is strictly convenient or you are dying of hunger. But even in the latter case you may be forced to wait some time so it may be a lost cause."

No matter it's the toasted pork, Peking duck or crab egg xiaolongbao, the restaurant did every dish to a perfection. Love the xiaolongbao, the crab yellow was so creamy, and generous in size. It explodes your senses. The hairy crab is a seasonal speciality and only available till mid November. Do not miss out your quota for the year. :) I tried the fried noodle pizza for the first time. The idea is to cut the pizza-like flat thin noodle into small pieces. First spread a thin layer of sugar, and use a spoon to drip a few drops of vinegar. Viola, crispy, slight sweet and sour. I never ate deep fried food, but was tempted to finish almost one slice..Steamed sea bass was also a delicacy. One spoon of fish soup into rice, and eat it with the fish, rich and yet refreshing.The staff was well trained, friendly and very attentive, made all the right recommendations.

However, minutes after there was some kind of alarm and apparently one area of the kitchen had water sprinkler going off and it was the area that made the pork belly and foie gras so were not able to get our dishes.

Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from ""the usual"". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))"

For starters, the bread was delish. I preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter. I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate soufflé. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the soufflé arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the soufflé. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!"

Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate soufflé. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate soufflé. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company."

I am formerly of New York City and had my fair share of solid steaks. I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative ""mixology"" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their ""spiked"" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)"

We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York.  D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point.  On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair.

Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes."

Besides that, the souffle and the creamed spinach is a must-have when you're there.Regarding the ambiance, I find that the dining area is rather dark and probably due to how the restaurant is layout, the noise/sound bounces off the wall which kinda make the place really noisy/loud when people start chitter-chattering the night away (which make it hard to carry conversation properly).

I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine. This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!Enjoy ~S."

Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house.

He went CUT in LA before and he said it was an underwhelming experience. The steaks were too 'modern' and even a bit pretentious. But I still want to try a modern steak house, and I haven't been to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before so curiosity got the best of me.The appetizers were alright. I've tried the oysters, pork belly, warm veal tongue, and they were all very decent.But the steak that I ordered was an extremely huge letdown. I've tried and fell in love with Snake River Farms beef before when I was in the US. Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-The rib eye itself was not that good too.

I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle. their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior. we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up. the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here. ----------------------------------------------old review:utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands.

It's not uncommon to find $100 steaks on the menus of many high-end restaurants. At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone. Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint.

But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly ""incomplete"" experience, because it is just that good.What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? ""It's not going to be the same.."" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again."

The drawbacks are that the portion sizes are a bit small - I usually order medium - and they are a little stingy with ingredients. But maybe this is because I'm comparing the current standard to when the stall was still run by the father at the Depot Road location.

That was before I discovered Zhen Shan Mei, which is located much nearer to where I live. I used to get my convenient fix of laksa sitting on the stools inside Queensway Shopping Centre, in between a casual stroll looking around for sporty stuff. Now, a five minute walk across to Alexandra Village brings me to one of the most 'sedap' bowls of laksa you'll find in Singapore.Some may not like it this way, but I adore this because it's so thick, rich and a fairly oily, so it not only leaves me quite full, but also satisfied to last till my next craving. It always feels good to eat out of a claypot, so there's that factor to this too, but I believe it's the way it's warmed in claypots that brings out that flavour in the soup. I wouldn't note this for its spiciness, because I don't recall having that big a sweat eating this, but even if you crave the chilli you will surely still enjoy this! Just ask for added chilli on the side, perhaps."

Although I'm sure it was still good, I appreciated the dedication to only serving perfect food. The staff was also very good - very attentive, reminded you of the specifics of the dish when serving, and generally accommodating. Specifics below, but recommend ordering the Cauliflower and Pigeon and sit at the bar. The paella looked incredible - watched them make at least a dozen.Food:Chorizo Iberico Croquettes: really really good, could eat them until I was sickShishito Peppers - came in some chimichuri / sriracha sauce which was terrific - was a daily specialRoasted Cauliflower - really really good. Combination of the char from roasting the cauliflower with the couscous and the creamy sauce is a home run.Grilled Octopus - good, but in comparison to the other dishes, lacked flavorRibeye - great flavor, perfectly cookedPigeon - must order - cooked to perfect,very flavorful, could eat several orders of this"

The Singapore outpost of Jason Athertons restaurant empire is not at all up to the level that one should be able to expect. The dishes are some sort of mid-sized dishes categorized by Sea,  Land and Soil. Much of the food is of very good quality, especially the Spanish Breakfast and the mini pork burgers standout. The food is however not the main problem, it is more the service that is faltering. We were just seated when we were told it is last orders. Why even accept reservations if you are closing the kitchen right away? The service was also in general slow,  20 minutes wait for a beer when the place is virtually empty isn't ok. Staff were also mostly interested in talking on the phone or with each other. We also had them without asking opening bottles of water and charging 9.5++ SGD per bottle. Selection of beer is boring and over-priced but the wine selection is good and can recommend the Torello cava. The prices per glass are however cheaper than buying a bottle (they claim 5 glasses per bottle and the price for a bottle is 6.9 times the glass price -  waitress just stared at me and left when I pointed out it was cheaper to buy per glass. Probably not her fault but the management need to have better pricing strategy). This all sounds like the place is bad but the redeeming feature is the food so hope the management can produce some decent service as the prices should mean that one can expect both food and service to be good."

The potato foam and the egg went deliciously well together, and was light on the palate, with the chorizo ketchup giving a nice homely aftertaste.- Esquina's Spanish omelette: confit onion, potato, crispy bread, olive oil caviar ($6) - this was alright, tasted more like lightly fried potato than anything.- Roasted cauliflower, cauliflower couscous, Serrano ham, manchego cheese ($16) - this was decent and flavorful; a tad too much oil though- Crispy baby squid, chili coriander, squid ink aioli ($14) - we ordered this at the spur of the moment, and it turned out to be one of our favorite dishes of the night. The squid was crispy and flavorful, and we loved the squid ink aioli. Perfect for munching over great conversation. Definitely get this to share.- Pigeon, forest berries escabeche, burnt Rosemary polenta, crisp shallots ($22) - this took forever to come, though the pigeon was juicy and tender. The berries were a nice touch. - Grilled Spanish octopus, Jerusalem artichoke, burnt onion, oyster leaf ($28) - the best dish of the night, in my books. The octopus was meaty and tender, loved the charred bits, and it went brilliantly with the artichoke puree. Highly recommend this.- Salted cod ""Alkorta"", iberico & tomato chickpeas, black garlic from ""Las Pedroneras"" ($28) - another brilliantly executed dish. The chickpeas and tender cod went fantastically with the sweetness of the black garlic, not to mention the visually stunning presentation. We were too full for dessert, but they did give us complimentary bites of chocolate ganache on bread.I liked that the chef made the effort to serve the dishes (we were seated at the bar) and introduce the dishes to us. However, the service was slightly off. The servers had a knack of interrupting us mid-conversation/mid-bite. Got slightly annoying after awhile. Overall enjoyable and worth a visit!"

The beauty is in using old school techniques and classic Spanish ingredients but presenting them in a new forms.  Impressive stuff."

Well three is a wrong number as we ended up ordering more and waiting and waiting because we didn't order at a go. How inefficient.We had the seaweed dashi poached oyster, which was okay, tasted like a boiled oyster with some dashi, nothing really special. I am not pleased to announce we were not impressed with the pork crackling as it tasted like pork flavored fried fish maw with some black roe on top. None of the lardy goodness we were expecting. We mostly got plates from the Sea section, the scallop sashimi with duck ham, lemon, and burnt cucumber was okay. Scallop sashimi has a delicate flavor and I felt the accompaniments overwhelmed it. Good accompaniments should accentuate the flavor instead. I did like that they left the scallops whole instead of slicing them thin or into pieces.Next up was the seared scallops with duck green curry and coconut rice. I don't eat peanuts so we got them on the side so that's good. The scallops were really good and seared properly but again the green curry didn't complement the scallops!We were hungry so we got the snapper, which was done quite well and came with pine nuts and couscous, with some orange. This went quite well as a dish and I rather enjoyed it. Last up for savories was the beef short ribs with cauliflower, tongue, and brown butter. This was a disappointment because we waited the longest for this and it tasted very ordinary. Well it just wasn't a party in my mouth. Meh. We ended the meal with desserts and had the chocolate mousse with popcorn milk and the manchego cheese pudding. We thought the popcorn milk sounded good on paper but it overwhelmed the mousse and textures wise, mousse and milk don't quite go well together.The cheese pudding was a welcome surprise as it was salty and sweet with the apricot jam that came with it. I liked it.Would I come here again? Probably not. This place is pricey, has soso service, and flavor combinations don't pair very well. I would go out on a limb and say this - the chef in charge of the menu is ballsy but doesn't have an amazing flavor palette. By tasting the food I think their cooking skills are up there, with excellent technique, but the menu is just a disappointment. There is innovative cuisine, and there is food mixed up on a platter. Every bite is a surprise, but not necessarily a good surprise."

Maybe walk-ins at Esquina will be possible until the hype dies down?Since I wasn't able to check out the interior, this review will strictly be about the food. As the dishes are tapas portioned, our server recommended that we order about 7 dishes between the 2 of us. Luckily, I wasn't too hungry that evening, so we were able to get away with just 5 (which definitely put our wallet at ease in the end.)I ordered 2 snacks. The warm thyme and onion bread was more like a typical butter croissant to me. I couldn't taste any of the thyme and onion. I did like the smoked bone marrow butter it came with, though- it was served in the bone, which was cool, and it had a distinct taste (in a good way.) My second snack was the pork crackling, which I loved. The dish is comprised of 2 big pieces of pork crackling, decorated with salt cod and smoked herring roe. It was creative and I'd order it again.For my main, I chose the ""soil"" category (basically, veggie based dishes.) I really enjoyed my beet salad. The burrata they used was what won me over. Hell, it also won Miguel over, and he doesn't even like beets! The raspberry and pinenut crumble was a nice touch and went well with the rest of the flavours. However, the truffle honey was a bit of a miss for me; Migs said he could smell it but I felt that it was lost amongst everything else that was going on.Despite the creative dishes, some of the flavours just don't come through. Considering the prices, I expect more. But I get the trendiness of it all, and it's definitely a place to be seen. I wouldn't come here if I were super hungry, but for drinks with friends or a light dinner, I'd be cool with it.--*Well, we did end up with a tiny table outside, which isn't ideal, but a table is a table! And yes, for the longest time, they didn't accept reservations, but now they do! Make your life a ton easier by booking an inside table through Chope. ;)"

It really came together well.tinyurl.com/bxpp6gkPork Cheeks - This was, to me, the weakest dish.  I know.  It is pork.  How can I say that about pork.  I just thought it was a touch dry.  The flavour was great.  The texture just didn't seem quite right.(no photo)Curry with lobster - This was a beautiful dish.  The curry was nice. At some level though, I thought the curry overpowered the sweetness of the lobster.  I think the dish could just as easily been made with a nice prawn.  Lobster is a delicate sweet taste.  it is easily lost.tinyurl.com/bea95ouThis meal was compliments of my manager.  However, I do want to note that I think this is a dining experience worthy of the associated price. Overall - This stands within the five best meals i've enjoyed in Singapore.  The food is the star of the show.  But certainly the energetic ambiance provides a strong supporting role.  The service was also very good.  Esquina is the type of dining experience I look forward to sharing with others.(lol - i do not usually mention other reviews.  however, according to one of the other reviews, i must be pretentious if i like esquina.  i just want to say if that is the cost for enjoying this wonderful dining experience, so be it.  i will be as pretentious as it takes.)"

Not a place for large groups because you can hardly converse farther than your immediate left/right. Ham Croquetas ($10) is my must order. 4.5cm tall balls filled with creamy bechamel and chunks of what is possibly iberico ham (i expect no less) left us wanting for more. The ham was a little salty but i love it.The Smoked Haddock, spring onion and Manchego omelette ($18) was the fluffiest eggs i've tried in a while. I would liken it to a souffle but firmer. The taste was light; simply flavored with the natural sweetness of the smoked haddock. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.Do order the Sauteed gambas, chili garlic, potato dumplings and bisque sauce ($24) even though it doesn't look spectacular.

But it somehow works, and it's constantly busy with customers returning for food which more than makes up for the slight discomforts. They have a few additional tables outdoors, but the ambience is definitely different from the flurry of activity taking place inside. We arrived after 7 on a Monday, and the indoor seats were already taken up. Nevertheless, the food was awesome, and we loved the clean, fresh flavours of the scallop cerviche. The Iberico Pork and Foie Gras Burger is delicious as well, but the foie gras flavours and textures weren't really present. The desserts - oh, the desserts - embody exciting flavours, and it was really difficult to make that final decision. A great place for tapas, that's for sure. Each dish in the meat and seafood categories will set you back at least SGD 20, but they're worth every penny."

But I love the space, love the energy, love the service, love the food!!Our server told us that it was an exceptionally crowded for a Thu. We started by sitting outdoors getting our drinks while waiting for a table. The wait was 1.5 hours by the time we got a seat inside. While outdoors, we started with some crispy baby squids with our sangrias. The sangria is yummy! And the crispy squid lightly battered and served with squid ink aioli. Do not expect our local version of crispy squid, Esquina does it with the squid still soft and juicy inside, while only the exterior is crispy. Dishes:- sea urchin and crab bisque. Like what Mark D. said, absolutely wonderful. The sweetness of the urchin is perfect and it is served with clunky crab meat. It is also served beautifully plated on a stone bowl.- ham croquetas. Filled with chunky iberico jamon, wonderfully salty and balanced with the potato filling. - marinated beet salad. It is too difficult to get good beets in Singapore. I never liked beet until I moved to NYC, and eating beets there totally changed my mind about this muddy veggie. The version here is still not like the beets we get in NYC, but the execution of the dish is faultless. It is served with burrata cheese and honeycomb. The honeycomb gave an amazing finish to the entire dish that it gave me pure joy....- beef tatare with frozen foie gras and confit egg yolk. This is served in small portions served with toast. We were not sure on what to expect when we read frozen foie gras. But when it was served, I knew it was exactly like the shaven foie gras pâté dish that I had in David Chang's momofuku ko restaurant where he served it up like a bowl of savory ice-cream. Totally yummy, and I only wish they are more generous with the shavings here. Complex flavors, beautifully executed.- seafood paella. Do not expect the traditional Spanish paella. This doesn't come with the soccarat (crispy bottom bits). It is closer to a rendition of risotto without the cheese, so it is much lighter and you can really taste the seafood bisque that they use to cook the rice. The seafood is served on the side and you get snapper, shrimp and crispy squid. I didn't feel that I need the seafood at all, quite happy with just the paella.Overall, really enjoyed the dinner. The tiny space reminds me so much of the little restaurants that peppered the village in Manhattan. It was a blessing in disguise that Burnt Ends was full till 9.30pm, which is why we ended up here. I was not impressed with Jason atherton's other restaurants in Sg, this one now totally changed my mind. Now....if only the wait is shorter!"

There were both hits and misses with the food but one gripe is that the size really can be afforded to be more generous even though they are tapas. Otherwise, it might be better to charge tapas price for tapas rather than main course prices for tapas.Foodwise, it was acceptable to me to experiment with the new creations but not for The Folks who commented that they had no idea what they were eating that night. Perhaps Spanish tapas might not be the cup of tea for everyone but I shall still continue to search for one that will be comfortable not only to the tastebuds but also to our stomachs and pocket."

We waited for about 45 minutes to get seats ... and that was at 930pm. Esquina doesn't take reservations, and I realise upon getting a seat that I might as well have eaten standing because they were really awkward and uncomfortable.Food : Wow, the heritage tomatoes with sherry dressing were something else. Fresh, juicy and sweet ... one of the best tomatoes we have had in a while, including the momotaro ones we usually have in Japanese restaurants. Good ham croquetas and we really loved the gambas as well as the scallop ceviche. The slow cooked egg was quite good and the ox cheek was quite soft and tender. The Iberico pork and foie gras burger was the winner of the night for my two friends however, they couldn't stop raving about it. We also really liked the sangria ice cream cone ... I think it was a daily special though.Ambience : Like the trend that seems to be going around for tapas bars, it also has an industrial chic vibe.

This place has serious cooking credentials.  Culinary Director Jason Atherton, notably Gordon Ramsey's protege, Michelin star winner and the first British Chef to complete a stage at the famed el Bulli restaurant in Spain, has teamed up with Irish Executive Chef, Andrew Walsh to create a stunning modern tapas restaurant. Esquina is reminiscent of tapas bars you would find in Spain.  A long, thin hallway with a bar, high stools and an open kitchen provides a chilled, relaxed atmosphere.  It's all about the food here, and you get the feeling you're in for a treat the moment you step through the door.The menu is innovative and exciting and there are also blackboard specials.  This is not your average chorizo and meatball menu, this is a whole other level of tapas entirely. Mr M, who requested to be referred to as 'The Stuntman' in this post (ok, I'll indulge him) and I dine on a Tuesday evening, and it's packed with a cool vibe.  The staff are friendly and we take our stools at the bar with the perfect view of the kitchen.  Executive Chef Andrew Walsh is on-board this evening and he helps us with our menu selections. The Stuntman and I choose our menu as follows:* Iberico Bellota* Tuna Tartare, wasabi celeriac remoulade, vietnamese dressing, crispy shallot (blackboard special)* Marinated beetroot salad, honeycomb burrata, pinenut crumble* Grilled Rib-eye, spice aubegine puree, lentil pearl barley dhal* Baked bone marrow with snails, parsley and horseradish pesto* Berry sorbet (compliments of the chef)* Watermelon salad, gazpacho, basil sorbet The food is exceptional and beautifully presented, with the standouts for me being the beetroot salad and the bone marrow (no easy feat given I wouldn't usually order bone marrow, or snails, for that matter)! This is an underground foodie den and well worth adding to your dining itinerary when you're next travelling through Singapore.  Imagine your street cred when you whip out this gem.  I have to say, Singapore has some amazing dining experiences - it's a foodie's paradise, take note!"

It has a very cool, industrial chic feeling to the small and narrow dining room. Sitting by the long bar looking across at the chefs prepare everything adds to the experience of this place. Unlike some of the other tapas places around Singapore, the food here is both contemporary and exciting.Had the tuna tartare was both fresh in produce used and flavor, tuna, avocado and sesame, simple , easy and worked really well. Full English breakfast was both a clever play on words and on the palate.  Desserts!! Strawberry gazpacho with basil sorbert was a fantastic way to finish. I've had too many bad basil sorbet experiences in my time, they are either far too sweet or don't resemble basil at all, though this one nailed it and married perfectly with the soup."

After looking through the reviews and pictures, I was really excited about the food because they looked beautiful in the posted pictures. Unfortunately, Esquina didn't deliver for me. The plating was beautiful, the service was good, and the decor of the place was chic and pretty. The most important thing though, the taste and flavor of the food, did not do it for me. We ordered all the popular dishes I've read about in the reviews. The pork cracking was just....fried pork skin. The pairing of the herring roe and salt cod mousse did not really push the taste of the pork to greater heights. Instead, it was just in general a flat dish. I have the same criticism for most of their dishes. The ingredients are good, but they just do not come together to deliver a dish of finesse or overlapping flavors. The jambon croquetas were good for what they were, fried cheese balls with ham, but even that was a tad too salty. The whipped burrata with beets was visually an astounding dish to look at, but again the essence of each element did not shine through. The burrata lacked the distinct milky taste, the pinenut crumble did not even taste strongly of pinenuts. So apart from the welcoming acidity the pickled beets brought, the dish was again flat, with no complexity. The uni bisque actually did have a good taste, and chock full of crabmeat that could have been sweeter, but the crab flavor overwhelmed the delicate uni flavor, and as a result, after the initial taste, the uni taste was barely detectable. Arguably the best dish of the night though. The pulled pork and foie gras burgers had good flavors going on, albeit a little too salty. I do appreciate that they blended the foie gras in the pulled pork patty. The sauerkraut was a little redundant though. In general, I thought that the items were overpriced for the taste level and the amount of food served."

I would have loved to comment on the food but the sad thing is that the food that we ordered did not arrive at all.  We had expected our food to arrive, as we were given fresh plates and cutlery while waiting. After waiting at our table outside the restaurant for approximately 30 minutes, we decided to check on our orders with the waitress/hostess who took them. When we asked the said waitress about our orders, she simply turned to the kitchen, without acknowledging our query, and asked the crew if our food was on the way. Crew informs her that it was not. The waitress turns back to us and curtly informs us that our food ""is not coming"". No apology was given nor an explanation proffered. Her dismissive attitude was completely shocking. It was as if we had spoilt her evening and put her in a bad mood, and not the other way around. I should point out that we did not even complain about the wait, but merely queried her on whether our food was coming. I don't care how good your food is if you treat your customers like crap. I get that orders sometimes get lost in the process, particularly at a busy joint like this. But no customer should be treated dismissively after a fruitless and unnecessary wait for the food. It's sad that my experience was marred by one person's truly appalling service."

While I fully know he's not gonna be cooking my tapas, I had the prior faith that Esquina will justify my good faith, and I won't say I'm disappointed. It's small, it's popular and overcrowded, but if you actually do get a seat by going strategically at 6pm, the rewards are sweet. Watching the finesse of two chefs working/performing in front of you, agile, swift and serious, I can hardly discount any dish as so-so. The effort is worth half the battle. But have you tasted the gorgeous  heritage tomatoes or the slow cooked eggs? I'm not saying that you will NEVER taste any better, for what I have to pay for them, I'd say dish them out every dinner! It's definitely worth my money, the consistent doneness of the egg with the patatas brava spin off is awesome. If the leg of ham doesn't instill any faith in how serious they are, I don't know what will."

And I should probably thank my friend for that.The laksa here is really good because of one thing: the gravy. The coconut milk infused gravy has a very rich and thick taste, and I could not stop myself from finishing all of it (are you nuts??!!). The level of spiciness was just right so I did not sweat like a pig, as I would usually do when eating spicy stuff.The laksa also came with a good amount of cockles which added that oomph to the already-awesome laksa.

However if I were to compare them to the one I used to have, I will comment that Laksa gravy spelled the differences. Their gravy was diluted and lack of the usual fragrance even though the taste was rather distinct.

The Wagyu at Fat Cow unlike any steak I've ever tried. It has the tenderness of a tenderloin yet the juicy taste of Ribeye. However, the pride and joy of Fat Cow is the PHAT Rice. ;-)  Perfectly cooked high grade Japanese rice layered with the oil drippings of the very Wagyu just prepared for you a few minutes prior.  Holy smokes!!!To tell you the truth, I started my dinner with the Fat Cow Donburi - Wagyu Beef with Onsen egg and shiro negi.

Fat Foa-Gura Don, 45Glazed foie gras and grilled wgayu beef over rice. omg. everything about this bowl was perfect. added a poached egg on the side, but it wasn't necessary. The sauce on the meats were already enough and so so good.. and the rice with the sauce was great as well. This bowl was .... perfect. I was already full from the sushi but I couldn't stop eating because it was that good.. Also had red radishes (I think) on the side to go along with it.You would think a restaurant not focusing on any type of food and having all these different types of Japanese food would decrease its quality and taste, but not this one. Everything was top notch and extremely yummy. When I'm back in Singapore, you will most definitely find me here."

However, with the downward revision of the already affordable lunch sets, I don't think anyone would be deterred from checking FC out. Each set comes with salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert with your choice of mains. Pick from the 12 mains which are priced from $25 to $48. Don't worry if you're not a beef fan, there are sashimi, pork and chicken on the menu too.The chawanmushi was topped with a light tasting crab sauce and it has prawn, mushroom and scallop in it.We ordered the Kinoko ($14), assorted Japanese mushrooms braised with sake, lime and butter. Honestly, it tasted like normal stir fry with a tinge of lime. A disappointment really. And it was a rather small portion.We also tried the Nasu Dengaku ($10), barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso. This is a tiny baby Japanese eggplant and it certainly isn't worth the price tag. There was a plum undertone in the salty miso which didn't sit well with the girls.We had the 2 hot favorites at Fat Cow, which is the Fat Foa-Gura Don ($42) and The Fat Cow Donburi ($38). It was a tussle between the 2 choices but here's the flavor profiles so that you can decide for yourself! The Fat Foa-Gura Don has the rich and buttery glazed foie gras chunks and grilled wagyu beef cubes. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but the overall flavor is strong and heavy. I liked the toppings on this one but i found the rice to be a little on the dry side and it acted like a sponge, soaking up all the oil from the goose liver..The Fat Cow Donburi is a simpler dish in comparison but it has its own merits. Charcoal grilled Wagyu Beef with a light garlic flavor, with onsen egg and shiro negi. The first thing we noticed about the dish was its truffle aroma.Break the egg and mix everything together and enjoy the moist and flavorful rice. Absolutely delicious."

They have sea food and Sushi like any Japanese restaurant, But you don't go there for that. Besides there are other places, arguably better. No you come for the beef. Forget the fancy Japanese meat dishes and just go for the slab of steak. They have Japanese, Australian and US. Skip the rest and head for the Japanese to really sample authentic wagu cooked to perfection. Order medium rare at most. Anything more cooked is sacrilege. Side dishes are meager but very good. The stuffed zucchini flowers are excellent, as are the various salads. Order the smaller portion of meat. Your wallet and stomach will thank you. The high fat content will fill you if you take the time to savor each piece. This is not the time to wolfing down your meal. Chew more times than you normally do before swallowing to get the full experience.  A side dish of fat rice is the perfect accompaniment.  Be prepared to pay through your nose though, but for that special occasion, go for it."

Us group of ladies decided on a Friday treat and managed to snag an inside table for 6. Most of us ordered the donburi despite the carbo threat - honestly, don't waste a single grain of the perfectly plump, chewy, sticky short-grain rice; it's that good. While 1 friend took the Hokkaido don (with seasonal seafood), 3 others ordered the Wagyu donburi with onsen egg while 2 of us went for the foie gras & wagyu donburi. The wagyu was everything you hope it would be - fat glistening cubes of meat that almost melted in the mouth with no resistance. I didn't expect the cubes of wagyu to be of such high quality - at least A3 if not higher.  The crisp pan-seared cubes of foie gras also had a nice smoky char that added to the fragrance of the bowl. I love my fatty (eg flavourful) meats, so this portion was perfect. Some thought it was a little too much but finished up anyway. The lunch set also includes miso soup, salad, a chawanmushi and dessert, all of an amazing quality that gives you a taste of the full fledged experience.Lunch sets available from Mon-Fri only, 12-3pm."

I was super excited about this foie gras and wagyu beef rice bowl, and boy, did it disappoint. The first time it was served, it wasn't what I expected. I had asked for rare, and dark chunks of over-cooked beef and foie gras (meagre serving) was just not what I had hoped for. I sent it back and the second time, it was still slightly overcooked but I did not want to send it back the second time. The thing that really gets me was the lack of marinate/ flavor in the beef cubes. It tasted like it was just salty, with no umami whatsoever. Service was good, servers were very professional.

The waiter explains that the beef is priced per 100grams, but you have to pay for a minimum of 200 grams, and the chef weighs the piece that they have, so you have no idea what it is going to cost. We got a cut each of the Australian Wagyu and the US Wagyu for $360. Between four people that is a ridiculously small amount of beef for the price.Starters were the dumplings and the sashimi special for $120 and it is itty bitty portions. Now the food was delicious, but there is no way you can justify that price for some raw fish that would fit on the average side plate.The beef was decent, but it does not take that much experience to cook it medium. We popped a bottle of wine for $170 and that rounded out the whole overcharged experience.A couple of tips for the management:1. Charge less or serve more. Your menu is misleading, and I hate being ripped off.2. If your restaurant is empty, why were some menu items unavailable?3. Train your servers better. Every time I took a sip from my glass, the waiter refilled it. In addition, they hovered around our table watching us before ordering, and watching us eat. Majorly annoying when you are trying to enjoy yourself with friends.4. Change the name and the location, they are both stupid.5. Better yet, just close up. You are not offering an awesome enough experience for $160 per head"

I am always on the look out for a nice slab of marbled meat. So far, Fat Cow's steak is the best I've ever tried. Being a big fan of steaks, I ordered the A5* wagyu steak, seared to medium rare.*A5 is the highest grade being awarded to wagyu beef. It is determined based on its marbling score, meat colour and brightness, firmness and texture of meat, and color/quality of fats.The steak was 300g and cost $298++. That comes up to more than $1/g and every mouthful that I took was probably worth $10 but it was so worth it! The divine taste of beef, fats that melted away without giving a greasy feeling, coupled with the grainy yet tender texture of the meat created the perfect steak ever. Every bite that I took, I went straight into heaven, lingered there for awhile, before coming back down for another bite. It was really that good. Of course, this was also the most expensive steak I've ever eaten so I was glad it measured up to expectations. The steak was served with a shoyu dip with grated ginger and sesame. Initially, I was skeptical about dipping such a marblellous piece of steak into shoyu but wow, the shoyu brought out the sweetness of the beef!!! We also asked for some freshly grated wasabi to pair with the beef because we liked that combination.We also ordered a few other dishes to share before the steak arrived. Traditional 'onsen-egg' served warm with a hunk of crispy fried beef bone marrow in a citrus dashiThe bone marrow was crispy and light with a tinge of sweetness while the citrus dashi added a refreshing taste. Break apart the yolk and you have a creamy balance of sweet and saltiness. A perfect appetiser!The zucchini stuffed with snow crab was amazing! The tempura was light and crispy yet not oily and there was a large amount of crab meat inside. The crab meat was fresh and sweet. We also had the choice of dipping it into mustard which excited our tastebuds. Overall, this was a unique dish and we loved it.Barbecued eggplant glazed with honey misoI am not a fan of eggplants but this was pretty good. After scraping off some of the miso (as it was too salty for my liking), the eggplant was actually palatable! It was so soft it almost melted in the mouth and I loved the slight chargrilled taste. The honey miso made it a really appetising dish indeed.Grilled gamba carabinerosI was really excited to see gamba carabineros on the menu. Gamba carabineros are a type of Spanish red prawn and ever since I ate them in Barcelona, I could not stop thinking about them. Like the ones I had in Barcelona, these were simply grilled with sea salt. The prawn was sweet and fresh but not as fresh as the ones in Barcelona as the meat was not as firm. Still one of the better prawns in Singapore though! For gamba carabineros, you MUST eat the brain juice! According to the chef in Barcelona, that is the best part of the prawn and the reason why gamba carabineros are so highly prized. Do not worry though, for the juice is really sweet.Handmade mochi with peanut and green tea powderThe mochi was extremely soft and chewy, sweet but not cloying. I preferred dipping it into the green tea powder for a slight bitterness.Milk pudding with red beansThis dessert was disappointing. While the pudding was smooth, it lacked taste and the red beans were too dry to help. This left an unpleasant taste and texture in our mouth.SummaryCost: ~$580 for 2 people, with 4 alcoholic drinksFood: Excellent steak! You have to order the A5!!!Service: Polite but slightly slowAmbience: Romantic, counter seating recommendedDress code: Smart casualWill I recommend it? Definitely!"

Both places seem to serve the croquestas on the same dab of garlic mayo..(incidentally the same garlic mayo dabbed on FOC's black rice paella and Binomio's squid ink pasta fideua).We had a daily special recommended by Chef, he called it the huevos dish and it was basically potato pieces fried with crispy edges served with an egg on top and in a skillet. Simple but again very yummy and perfectly seasoned (ie not too salty).One of Ning's and my favourites (Nadia doesn't like tomatoes) was the watermelon gazpacho with charcoal olive oil ice cream. We ordered one portion to share and Chef Jordi thoughtfully split the ice cream into 3 separate bowls. The gazpacho was incredibly smooth and tasty and tomatoey with just a touch of sweetness from the watermelon. Nadia doesn't like tomatoes (other than fresh ones in salad or in the background like pizza sauce) but she loved the icecream mixed with the gazpacho and ate up every last drop of her portion. That's how good it was.Food was very tasty without being cloyinging rich and greasy which can be the risk of Spanish restaurants (in Spain as well as here!). The black rice (arroz negro) with seafood paella $22 was luscious without visible separated oil unlike Binomio and La Bomba and Sabio). The plumpness and bite of the rice was perfect, really good quality rice handled well.Another strong recommendation by Chef Jordi, the grilled ribeye at $35 was meltingly tender and served medium rare. Originally I thought he was talking about the 1kg beef on the bone..and I asked ""Erm..too much for us 3?"". He said No! Just nice for sharing..(I was thinking OK..maybe we look very hungry) and later when I realised it was a ribeye steak portion PHEW I told him about the intiial misunderstanding and we had a good laugh about it. This was 150g and we were all commenting how tender and juicy and really good the meat was and my other 2 friends also raved on about the grilled peppers served on the side of it.Note on the cocktails. Nadia had the Smells Like Gin Spirit $14. Tasty and refreshing gin version of a mojito. I had the Chef's favourite, Bloody Jordi also $14 and is a bloody Mary type with an Asian sour twist. Looking at the description again that must be the Kimuchi no Moto (korean kimchi base). Dario the mixologist said it had 1.5 shots of tequila in it. I couldn't taste the alcohol but he said it was not meant to be a strong alcohol forward drink. It's true the spices and tomato was the prevalent sensation and not everyone will like that flavour combination but it was interesting to try something new. My friends all commented it was so savoury like a soup and it did go down very easily. I suppose it's a silent killer but I was happy to get on to the excellent house wine - I had the Angelitos Negros 2013 at $10.50 a glass!After all that Chef asked if we wanted a small bite each. He then prepared 3 pieces of scallops topped with their soy ""caviar"" (tapioca sago) so we could have 1 each when the standard serving is 2. Fresh juicy and plump w slight char $16.We went through the courses very smoothly (all tapas but felt like a proper dinner all the way) and happily ended with the chocolate burger at $12 and the Torrija $10. Overall food was fresh, not overstated, not over-seasoned, refreshing, very yummy but not bludgeoning on the palate. A small portion of Torrija with a candle and with happy birthday written in dulce de leche on the plate was served complimentary. And unexpectedly, even the valet (from Purple Valet) waited to close all our doors for us as we got into the car. I don't know if that's part of the restaurant training but kudos."

Of all the dishes we had tonight, only the cauliflower and duck confit were good. Scallops came out completely raw in the middle...asparagus were overcooked to the point of being mushy...not to mention we were served the fibrous bottom. If you are going to serve the bottom of the asparagus, then you may want to shave it! Cuttlefish paella with saffron came out crunchy and looking completely brown and absent of any saffron. The rice was so undercooked and it tasted very muddled. I have never seen saffron flavored rice to be brown...why would you cover up the nice yellow color of saffron...maybe it's a false item in the description and none was ever used??? Beef cheek burger was okay and lamb chops were bland."

I tried the Lord Sidecar- loved the sage and it was a great starter for a hot and humid day.I was surprised at the patatas bravas- their rendition had a saucy kick to it. The grilled foie gras sliders were very rich, definitely a treat meant to be filed under ""sometimes food only""! My husband and I were also impressed with the Black Mediterranean Squid Ink Paella. A mouthful to say, but when that mouthful's in your mouth, it's damn shiok.My only constructive feedback was that it was slightly warm where we were sitting.

Yes it's a star studded team!Expect a contemporary small plates menu with Catalan and Mediterranean influences, complemented by a selection of inventive cocktails. They even created a selection of Asian inspired tapas which were honestly pretty darn good.HITS!Cochifrito. Crispy Pork Taco ($14/2pcs). This is one of my favorites if not the top favorite dish. This is FOC's take on the Mexican taco, and that crispy shell was too addictive. It's like a really awesome fried wanton skin filled with tender pulled pork. I really liked the crispy pulled pork. I didn't even mind the dou miao and I don't even like bean sprouts. Now could we have this in jumbo size or what?Bocata de foie-gras a la brasa y shitake marinado. Grilled foie-gras with marinated shitake and green apple ($22/2pcs). Loved that broiche bun with a glossy blistered exterior. It was very crunchy and extremely buttery. Even though the foie gras was on the oily side, it had a nice creamy texture and i liked that the green apples added that tinge of tartness.FOC Hamburguesa de chocolate FOC chocolate burger ($12). Now here is one carefully crafted dessert burger made from white chocolate, vanilla mousse, strawberries and mint leaves. You should eat it all together for a balanced review of this dessert. The combined flavors of the smoky caramel, sweet milk chocolate and the tart strawberries were delightful. The cream in the 'bun' had a marshmallow texture too!DRINKS! Innovative, strong and very affordable! They start at $13 and cocktails are available ALL DAY. Say WERTTTT!MISSESVieiras con caviar de soja. Scallops soy caviar ($20). It's scallops, and it's nicely seared and it's in a salty soy. There's really nothing else to it.""Cansalada"" confitada con pure de coliflor. Confited pork belly with cauliflower puree ($14/4pcs).

Service was flawless, food was amazing. Worth every cent. Great for a fun night out when you're in the mood to splurge a little. Total bill for 2 came up to $115 (incl. GST & service charge) without drinks.We had:- Mushroom croquettes ($10 for 4). Served fresh, each croquette can be finished off in 2 delightful bites. The inside is a gooey mess of cheese, cream and mushrooms. Wonderful starter to whet your appetite.- Squid ink paella ($26). Perfect for sharing, also gorgeously photogenic. Each grain of rice was plump and flavorful and mixed with hidden octopus chunks, which was a pleasant surprise. It was topped with juicy prawns and clams and dollops of aioli. We wiped the pan clean. I must confess I never was a fan of paellas, but this one hit the ball out of the park. - Grilled octopus ($22). Juicy octopus nestled on a bed of flavorful mashed potato topped with paprika. Only minor gripe was that some parts were so charred that I ended up tasting more bitterness from the burnt bits than the actual octopus. The octopus itself, on the other hand, was tender and meaty. Absolutely delicious. - Iberico pork ribs & pumpkin mash ($30). Our least favorite dish of the night. Perhaps also because we were getting pretty full by then and this dish ended up feeling too heavy. The ribs were very fatty and the savory pork didn't go that well with the sweet pumpkin. It was decent on the whole though. - Chocolate Galaxy ($12). They bring the chocolate dome to the table and pour hot chocolate syrup over it on front of you, so you watch as the chocolate shell melts to reveal 3 mini profiteroles within. Ended up being essentially a chocolate ""soup"" with 3 cream-filled profiteroles. We didn't think we would be able to finish it, but we did! There were crunchy bits at the bottom which was a nice touch. Great for sharing.Didn't manage to try this time, but I've also heard good things about the mini chocolate burger and the watermelon gazpacho. Will definitely return! Love this restaurant :)"

From Michelin-starred restaurants (which I'm not sure is the best way to assess the more traditional dishes, but then again this region was under French protection at one point ) to a home kitchen, the food in Catalunya is fantastic. If food was reason alone for granting autonomy, I say why not! Anyway, let's leave the politics aside and talk about FOC. I didn't visit Can Jubany in Osona but I bet FOC is equally good. Spanish food by the Spanish, not too pricey and portions were sufficient (here's looking at you, Serenity). I was craving some fideuà, which is like the ang moh version of hokkien prawn mee...and the chef gamely obliged with his rendition of squid ink fideuà. It was very tasty with a good amount of wok hei! We also had the croquettes, which had mashed potatoes so mashed it was practically a mouth-watering puree; sardines with pickles 9gives your palate a good puckering up), fresh and very sweet tomatoes, the potatas bravas (kinda skimpy on the seasoning and not greasy...which I kind of associate with the dish but hey this will do) and the battered cod fish balls with apple puree (interesting but kind of mushy with not too distinctive flavors i.e. I couldn't tell it was cod). Up to this point, the food came out at a steady pace and then we had a long wait. I checked on the waiter and realized the kitchen had forgotten our grilled octopus and the egg with pork belly and truffle special...while the clock was ticking on when we had to vacate our seats because of the two cover policy and because I had a show to catch at the Art House. The octopus was served shortly and much as I had hyped up my dining partner on the wonders of Spanish octopuses (they are in fact ridiculously taught, smoky, crisp and mind blowing), the FOC version kind of disappointed. Time in the Josper grill somehow robbed the octopus of its juices, though I liked the char on top, so this was an ""ehhh"" dish that could've been so much better. The eggs with pork belly and truffles (what a combo right) never came and I think I actually paid for it in my haste. I didn't check the bill thoroughly but on hindsight at $180 and some quick math off the website, I think I was charged for the dish that never went into my belly even though I would've loved to taste it.Finally a note on the cocktails. I had the cuzco sour...because if you've hiked all over Peru you would have romantic memories of this lovely drink (not so much of the chicha). It was very balanced - the right amount of tart lime/lemon and the requisite egg whites and bitters on top. My second drink was a Bangkok something, which I asked the waiter to recommend based on my preference for something ""refreshing"". It ended up being almost exactly the same as the sour except for some supposed chilli's that were mild to non-existent. Maybe I'm being a little picky but the mark of front of house would be one that watches both your food and drink selections and offers pairings that work with the food or takes you in a different direction from your first. I felt the team fell short here though it's not surprising given how busy the restaurant was.Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal at FOC, probably because the food and drinks came soon enough that I was willing to over look the slow service towards the end and the incorrect billing."

It's pricey, but no more expensive than any other Spanish restaurants aroundWe had:1) Heuvos Estrellados con Chorizo ($10) - a breakfast hash of fried potatoes, chorizo balls and a just-cracked egg, still sizzling on the hotplate: Smoosh it all together, and you get a glorious mess of runny eggy delight. Our favourite tapas here.2) Croquetas de Setas con Jamon ($10 for 4): a mixed platter of mushroom croquettes and Spanish ham croquettes, bursting with creamy goodness, and tempered with the contrast of the soft mash and crunchy breadcrumbed coat.3) Tortilla Abierta con Trufa y Pimientos del Piquillo ($26): an open tortilla with blistered red peppers, truffle strips and aioli was simple but done fantastically. It was just the right balance of rich aioli, aromatic truffle, sweet peppers and eggy pancake.4) Gambas al Ajillo ($18): a classic of sauteed prawns in white wine and garlic, notable for 2 things: the copious use of really good white wine, which made this the most heady rendition ever - I think I got a little high from this; and incredibly sweet prawns still with shells on, for maximum flavour infusion to the sauce. A tip: get bread to mop all the deliciousness up.5) Vieiras a la Brasa con Caldo de Bonito y Caviar de Soja ($16): a couple of fat succulent scallops grilled to a beautiful caramelization, and dunked into a delicate bonito stock and topped with soy beads. Great fusion of Asian flavours6) Costillas de Cerdo a la Brasa con Pure de Calabaza Ahumada ($30): seriously good, premium iberico pork ribs, burnished with rosemary, were grilled to a juicy smoky finish, and sided by a smoked pumpkin puree.7) Arroz Negro con Mariscos y ""All I Oli"" ($24): perhaps the best squid ink paella I've ever had. The moreish squid ink was nuanced and countered with the creamy bite of aioli. You can't quite see it, but there was as much rice as there was squid dice, so that's really amazingly generous."

Would have loved to try their scallop ceviche with guacamole and grilled scallop but both weren't available. Finished off with the tarta tatin done with a modern twist which was agreeable with me.They have an interesting, well priced and fairly extensive cocktail menu complete with a taste guide. Alas, the cocktail itself was very average. Had the red sangria which tasted rather like grape juice with added sugar. The service here deserves commendation. Efficient and smiley, a rarity in SG. I will be back."

I hate that they do two sittings, one at 6:30pm and the other at like... 9. It's ridiculous. Some of us work till 7 ish, 8, and there's no way we can wait till 9 to have dinner. So the only time I've eaten at FOC is for a work dinner, when the entire office got off work early, just so we could eat here. Other than with such special arrangements? I'm basically never going to be able to dine here on a weekday.The food was... good. Not mind-blowing. Not amazing. Just... good. And not even enthusiastically good. Granted, I didn't order items off the menu, we had a pre-ordered selection of the menu because we were such a big group, but I think we hit many of the popular items. The octopus was good, but not the best, or second best I've had in Singapore. The eggs scrambled at the table with fried potatoes, brilliant idea, but the hot-plate wasn't hot enough to actually cook the eggs, so we had very raw egg white, slightly cooked egg-yolk, and brilliantly crisp potato bits. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and very addictive, and I'd definitely order it again... if I do go back. The seafood paella was popular with some, though the seafood taste got a bit overpowering by the 4-5 spoonful. Mushroom croquettas? Brilliant. Creamy, practically fall apart croquettas with a strong distinct mushroom taste. Really good. But better than a good creamy jamon croquetta? Unfortunately... no.So maybe you'll enjoy FOC more than I did if you're a fan of cocktails. I didn't order any because I was driving, and was having wine. But right now, I'd rather head to UNA for my tapas fix."

Where do I start? First of all - its a good idea to reserve a table or seats. Depending if you are interested to see how they make the food or if you just want to sit and relax with your friends. The decor is cool - reminds me of the cool kid clubs in Berlin - and the service awesome. The food: You might want to go for exercise before you enter the sinful temple of culinary highlights - as you will most likely eat more than usual because its just so good. Usually I sit at the bar and let the boss decide what he is going to serve me as so far - he never disappointed. From the gazpacho to the clams over the chorizo to the creme catalan (which is a MUST HAVE!!) everything is just amazing. I have been to Barcelona and never had such amazing tapas. The way the food is combined - the flavours, the consistency and structure is very different, surprising and every time like a food symphony.  What I personally like is that the way the spices are used is so balanced that I don't need to put on extra salt or any other sauce. For me that means that a dish is perfect and that is extraordinary. Drinks: Their wine and beer selection is quite good but I normally stick to my two favourite cocktails: Old Fashion Churchill and Bloody Jordy (which - if you like body mary - is a MUST HAVE TOO!!). Last but not least - I went there once with a colleague who is vegetarian - and even for him there was a lot of choice and he really enjoyed the food too. I will keep coming back. The prices are reasonable for this kind of haute cuisine. Simply a great restaurant!"

The staffs were rushing the lunch crowd, so that they could start to prepare for the dinner. I wish that I had been informed when I placed my order. I felt kind of being rushed through the meal."

One did not get a sense of pride of the history of this restaurant which has had such a wonderful past.Appetisers: pretty good: cold cuts, burrata, and scallop tartar (not quite Italian though).Main courses: big disappointment: The Coniglioni with Duck ragu came over-baked and therefore the pasta shells were hard and tough to chew. The duck ragu was slightly too sweet.Risotto with shrimp: average.Spaghetti carbonara: too creamy and lacked the authentic flavor of a true carbonaraBranzino: small portion served in an uninspiring manner with tired vegetables around it.A great positive: The views are wonderful.Overall however, a tired, uninspiring and very overpriced dining experience with poor execution of Italian dishes ($150+ per person with one bottle of wine)."

It fits the mold of a perfunctory fine dining restaurant with it's white linen, sharply dressed waiters and a hostess at the front desk with a remarkable memory. Thing is while the food is good and the service is as it should be for people who lunch in 45 minutes, I feel like this restaurant lacks heart or passion and that's why it scores a 3/5. At a recent lunch, I had the crab salad to start with and a seafood casserole for my mains. I believe the menu changes monthly with the seasons so these items may not be available year round. The crab salad was light and refreshing with a mold of fresh, juicy crab and just enough dressing drizzled on the plate. My seafood casserole was deceptively filling, served in a cast iron pan. I had pieces of cod, lobster, mussels and other treasures from the sea, cooked perfectly in a tomato base. Before my orders came, we were given a plate of cheese shavings and bread, both of which were extremely addictive and threatened to ruin my meal. In all, I can't complain about the food, decor and view but the restaurant lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.

For mains I had the halibut filet, which the waiter recommended over the veal. It was crisply seared and succulent inside, and fresh.However, that was the only high note. The rest of the meal was technically alright but singularly uninspired.The starter, two small slices of raw salmon with pesto, was decent but not memorable. Our second course of pasta - garganelli with forest mushrooms - was better, but I didn't feel compelled to finish it. The pannacotta dessert that followed was monotonous and yawn-inducing.The sugar biscuits they served with tea/coffee after were a tad more interesting, but not compelling enough to save this."

Our waiter introduced us to the set-menu, five courses with coffee, all truffle-themed for 188 S$ per person. It sounded great but we did not want to eat all that much - and spend a little less on dinner.We decided to go with half a dozen oysters (Australia & NZ), shared a scallop/white truffles pasta starter and had pan roasted sea bass with vegetables as main.The food was delicious, the oysters fresh and very tasty, the pasta with scallops cooked to perfection and with the fresh truffle shavings just divine.The fish had a nice crispy skin and the meat was just perfect both in terms of texture and flavour.We had chosen a Sauvignon blanc/Semillon from Australia to go with the food, which was lovely and at 88 S$ one of the cheapest choices on the extensive and expensive wine list. We found that the wine in general was overpriced but since we hadn't splurged on food for some time we decided to treat us to it - this however being the reason for 4 stars instead of five, as it really blew us away.Service was very good and professional, and consistent throughout which has become somewhat of a rarity these days, unfortunately.This place is perfect if a celebration is in order - actually there were two local parties celebrating a birthday complete with cake and candles :-).We will certainly be back some day for their excellent Italian food (the executive chef is Italian) and perfect service."

The spaghetti was marvelous, proving the high standards of this Italian restaurant as the pasta was cooked to al dente and tossed in a flavorsome tomato-based sauce with a touch of alcohol. The Osso Buco Con Risotto stole the show, with the braised veal shank so tender and succulent. The creamy and rich risotto perfectly complemented the savory veal. The standards of this restaurant are heightened by its impeccable service. The staff was warm and friendly, and not to say attentive and accommodating when taking our orders."

Replacing Cedele (moved to punggol waterway) in the same spot opposite My Village shopping centre. I've not eaten the claypot rice at geylang before so am not able to make a comparison. You have to pre-order the claypot rice before you reach the place so that you can skip the 30 mins wait of preparation. hmmmm thats kinda troublesome to me. Teh! The claypot rice comes in 2 sizes. Small $18, good for 2  & large $28 good for 4. The server will ask if you would like to mix the salted fish and dark soy sauce while he mix the rice. Traditionally, salted fish is added in for a smoked fragrant. It might look intimidating to some because it looks like a piece of stale meat. The claypot rice is really good! The chicken & chinese sausage portion is generous, in comparison, the few strands of choy sim on top of it looks pathetic. Anyway i think its for plating purpose. If you would like to add more vegs, they have many choices on their menu. We had nai bai with fried enoki, tofu with prawn & salted veg duck soup. The veg & tofu are ok.. I didnt like the salted veg duck soup. Its too salty for me & doesnt go well with the rice. It should go well with plain rice. There isnt a crowd during lunch. The servers are attentive to the extent that whenever someone dropped their chopsticks, they rushed to us. The shape of the bowls that they are using should be changed! It doesnt hold the chopsticks well and it rolls off our table. But they look chic for ... claypot rice. I will return for lunch as its air conditioned & water is served. Not too bad to hide from the heat. Hmm yes, gst + service charge. Total bill: $97.60 for 6 of us."

It is no wonder they have become a household name in Ghim Moh.The husband-and-wife team wake up in the wee hours to start making the chwee kueh by hands, not machines. However, the main difference between this chwee kuey and Tiong Bahru or even Bedok ones is the chye poh (preserved radish). Ghim Moh's ones ($2.40 for 8pcs) are super salty. No sesame seeds, no sugar. The preserved radish is stir-fried with pork lard and garlic, making it extra fragrant. They are undeniably oily, but I like. I thought the auntie was stingy on the chye poh...as they are really very very little (teochew ah pa says that the uncle tends to give toppings more generously then the auntie).

Over the years, I got older and more adventurous, yet have not found anywhere selling chwee kueh quite like this. The actual 'kueh' itself is on the right side of being solid - so many others tend to be a little jelly-ish, or a bit too ricey, or just not quite there. The texture and bite of this kueh is the standard for me, and though the difference is not that big a deal in the overall enjoyment, I'd like to take note of this anyway because it reminds me of all the sweat and love that has gone into this hand-made process, where the uncle rises early every morning unfailingly to build that pagoda of chwee kueh you will see behind them in the stall. For a few weeks last year I saw him with a cast around his arm, yet a warm smile on his face. I am happy knowing he is happy making us all so so happy.The magic of this chwee kueh lies in the chye poh. Once you've had chye poh like this and enjoyed it as much as I always enjoy it, it genuinely puzzles me how you could love another sort. This chye poh is the savoury sort, always runny with a little oil, always with a few rough bits to add a little accidental juxtaposition to the texture in your mouth. This is quite unlike the sweet and dry chye poh in a rum-brown colour that you see in so many stalls around - too consistent a texture, and too likely a sweetness. My only qualm might be that there is often not enough chye poh per square centimetre on my chwee kueh, but if you will give the auntie a nice smile and ask politely, she will certainly oblige in giving you a spoonful or two more from her bubbling cauldron.At about 30 cents per piece you're for such a treat - such a treat! Thinking about it now even makes me want to weep, and I have just had 6 pieces myself this morning! It makes me even more delighted to give business to such nice people (not that they need it - there's often a line, but never long enough to turn you off). The auntie is a joy to make conversation with, and even though she's been told how many years into my studies I am on more than one occasion now, she still always forgets and asks again in the most endearing way. I'll miss this for sure if it ever goes away - it is my last bastion of chwee kueh hope in Singapore!"

I only wish such attention was paid to our food and our meal.it feels rather a waste to tell you what we had - so I shan't. the best dish of the day was perhaps a dish of greens with lily bulbs and tofu skin, and putien's rendition (though slightly different in execution) puts it to shame.none of the dimsum was inedible or terrible, of course, but you don't expect it to be. but I direct you to the paradise group, or yum cha for a better meal - and at much better prices. hotel chinese dining is usually expensive - they come with a pedigree and quality not necessarily attainable at less costly places - but I was pretty annoyed upon paying the bill here.even the sang meen, that cantonese restaurant mainstay of crispy fried noodles served with a dark gravy and seafood, was uninspiring (to say the least). I can't say if it was perfect when it came out of the kitchen, but it spent a careless and incredible amount of time sitting on the waiting table next to us, where we got increasingly concerned - and annoyed - looking at it, as time passed.trying to get attention was pretty futile as our attendant was busy at another table - and when the noodles finally arrived, they had lost their crispness, and taken on an unappealing sponginess from having soaked up all that gravy. the seafood was also of alkali-soaked bouncy consistency, which I attribute more to my local coffee-shop than a restaurant such as this.even the desserts were just so - and my herbal jelly wasn't even fragrantly bitter or firm (it seemed more like a slightly more elastic grass jelly).so, can you tell I was annoyed? bear in mind that servings of dimsum are twice the price they would usually be, tea is served and priced at extravagant per-cup prices (acceptable if they actually had some sort of flavor), and service seems both harried and impossible to get.I hope it a one-off, and I certainly wish you a better meal than mine."

This is a cosy restaurant in beige, both the furnishing and the waiter/waitresses. The food, like the service, is excellent, unpretentious and of good value. This is a place perfect if you love a quiet evening of good food, no frills, and want to focus on just your food and company. My first assessment of a restaurant's quality is the bread basket. I believe if a restaurant puts the effort to serve good warm bread that comes free, it can't go very wrong. And we polished off the bread. We weren't even that hungry. The Caesar salad with anchovies was so unassuming, we were a little disappointed at first glance. But once we started, we couldn't stop. The quail was exquisite. Paired with foie gras, and balanced with walnuts and beetroot, it was flavorful and yet not over-powering. Slightly crispy skin and juicy inside. I ate this 2 weeks ago and I still dream of it. I was reluctant to order the chicken at first, because well, it's chicken. Chicken to me is usually a safe choice, can't go very wrong, but not fantastic either. But Gordon Grill's grilled farm chicken as brought chicken to a whole new level. Once again, flavorful, juicy, not oily, and brought out the taste of chicken so well. The chicken melted in my mouth. I thought I died and went to chicken heaven. The grilled pork was pink with perfection. I can't go on further without my mouth watering again. Every dish we had was prepared with thought and care, it was evident. This place is as if it stopped in time where quiet dignity and taking pride in preparing a quality filling meal were cherished. I can't wait to go back there."

We might be occasionally distracted by the new trendy restaurants popping up on the dining scene, but when it comes to deciding on a place where it's cosy, peaceful and reliable, we head straight for Gordon Grill.Food : We always look forward to the crispy snack they provide along with the bread basket. I don't know what it's called but it's uber yummy! I also really like the bread basket. I'm a huge fan of the chilled angel hair pasta with king crab and caviar. One can opt to have it prepared warm as well, but I prefer the chilled version. The lobster bisque is lovely but the highlight of my meal is naturallement, the grilled ribeye. The Snake River Farm wagyu is one of the best ribeye steaks I've had in Singapore (Fat Cow uses the same one we had done charcoal grill style) and they bring it out on the beef trolley to show you the marbling and ask you how much of it you want. Half the fun of having the crepes Suzette is watching it done table side and it's always done really well.Ambience : Cosy and peaceful without loud music or loud conversation. It might be fine dining but it's not overly formal.Service : One of the best. They make it a point to recognise their customers and their preferences. I approve. All service in Singapore should aspire to their standards.I make it a point to try and go at least once a month. You should too!"

Gunther's *modern french* dining certainly lives up to its name. I had Gunther's when it first opened a long time ago & i'm glad to be back again tonight. Signature dishes:Angel hair pasta with caviar. Back then this signature dish was all the rage and it still tastes just as good. Light & heavy flavors at the same time to match perfectly with a nice champagne.The foie gras with crushed almonds & hibiscus sauce is a classic & it's return to the menu is a welcome return. Again, light & heavy flavors will match with a nice burgundy or red. Apple tart is not in the photos i uploaded but it is another must try dish. Light flaky crunchy crust matches very well with a light apple filling that won't overwhelm your stomach but is a very welcome end to one's meal & palette. Today's dishes that i had that were memorable... actually they were all great!Onion cheese gratin - a very french influenced dish using onion, the texture & sweetness of the onion is brought out nicely. Langoustine meuniere - full of prawn flavor yet it is very very light. It is sliced very thinly so the gamey taste of raw prawn is not overpowering but its sweetness is brought out, nicely balanced with the cream & caviar.Carabinero gambas prawn - Gunther's is very capable to do a sharing portion for 2 tonight. The 2 spoonfuls of tomato & slightly spicy rice is full of flavor. The prawn is cooked just right with some tasty roe. It's head & brains is cooked to perfection! Pork Belly & Coquille Pasta - Very large portions for sharing. The pork belly is very fulfilling, comforting & satisfying to one's belly. The sauce would match well with a margaux or burgundy! I was feeling very full at this point BUT dessert beckons!For dessert, crepe suzette that was also shared between me & my guest. Gunther's staff will put on a nice show to flambe the crepe's in front of you. The orange sauce is tangy served with an equally tasy ice cream & light crepes that is nicely burnt in a few places. Ambience:Gunther's decor is very simple but its ambience is quite quiet & there are not many tables that adds to the exclusivity of dining here. This is a nice place for a romantic dinner for two.Price: Special's & seasonal items can be quite expensive but given that gunther's is willing to do sharing portions & some dishes are large portions, at least one's belly will not go hungry after the meal. As always, lunch is the best time to go for value for money. Monday's & tuesday are corkage free which adds tremendously to gunther's value. Service:The ratio of servers to each table is approximately 1 to 1-2 tables depending on how booked Gunther's is. Every staff is friendly and willing to explain anything. I recommend Mogish who is a long time staff to take good care you. Overall: Gunther's has been fabulous. My guest was equally delighted. Each dish is a nice gastronomical surprise & a nice refresh of memories from my first dining experience at gunther's. I will return soon! Thanks chef & team!!!"

Located in the middle of the shophouses, next to its sister restaurant Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar, another equally well known restaurant. Although the restaurant is quite high end with its equally expensive priced menu, it offers quite a reasonable priced 3 course lunch set at $38++ which is available on weekday.The restaurant is decorated in grey with paintings and dim lights around which gives an elegant setting. Besides the usual menu, the staff also make his offers on what is in season by using a ""daily special cart"". Today there is vegetables from Japan, lamb, wagyu beef, and assorted seafood such king crab, scallop. But the one which holds everyone's attention is the truffle. Even when covers in a glass cover, one can easily smells the earthy pungent smell.Before starting the meal, one is served with hot towel to wipe with. One is served with a pipping warm mini buguette and butter to start the meal. Though the bread looks hard, it is quite crispy and soft to texture.For today's lunch set, there is 3 choices for starter : Farmer's salad, Clear vegetable soup, and Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up egg. Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up eggThe mushroom is quite well flavoured.Next is the main which also comes with 3 choices : Gunther's Creation (seafood pasta), Braised lamb stew, Leffe beer, and Charcoal grilled Wagyu steak (additional S$20++).Cold Angel hair pasta, Oscietra caviar ($60++)However I decide to go with the staff's recommendation to topup $40++ more to change the main course to the restaurant's signature cold pasta dish. It is quite popular which could be found in most tables. Refreshing cold and smells great of truffle which makes one high before eating.The last course is the dessert which also comes with 3 choices : Dessert of the Day (Pineapple Panna Cotta), Cheese Platter (additional S$10++), and Fine apple tart ""à la dragées"", Havana rum raisin ice cream (additional S$8++).Fine apple tart ""à la dragées"", Havana rum raisin ice cream ($25++)The apple tart is different from the traditional apple tart. It looks more like a flat pizza. Thin slices of soft caramelised apple on a very thin base. Crunchy and crispy on the outside. The ice cream is rich and creamy. Pairing the cold ice cream and the warm apple tart together is quite a yummy combination.Lastly there is coffee or tea and Petit fours to end the meal with.The coffee is quite rich with a slight bitter and chocolaty taste. I have it with just milk and without sugar. It is just nice to balance with the sweetness from the dessert and petit fours. The petit fours consists of Financier, Canele, Wafer and chocolate. I like the canel, which has a soft and tender custard center with a dark, thick caramelized crust.Overall the food is quite delicious. The place is packed even it is a weekday lunch time.

But not sure if we'd return again."

Gunther's Modern French Cuisine is one of the Top 20 restaurants in The Miele Guide with Set Dinner Menu at a price tag of SPD$ 128++. The SPD$38++ lunch set menu for sure sounded like a bargain.Purvis Street where Gunther's located is quite interesting. The business/restaurants here has this mix of the different cuisine of traditional VS modern, new VS old, local VS international. The co existence of all these restaurants is just how Singapore is as a whole.Gunther's is smallish with just a handful of tables so reservations is highly recommended.There are a couple of choices for Appetizer and Main, and  I decided on the following:Green Asparagus with Ravioli Foie Gras - I just could not resist when I saw foie gras on the menu. The sauce really complimented the Foie Gras as I cleaned my dish with the warm baguette. The asparagus was cooked perfectly with just the right crunch.Oven roasted cod, béarnaise sauce - I found it is just OK, average the most. The Tempura vegetables lack the crispness and off the fryer freshness. Dessert of the Day - Earl Grey Pudding - which is really really good! Light, Smooth and with just the right amount of sweetness!Followed by Petite Four and ended with a cappuccino.The Chef also gave me a taste of their Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar - All I can say is CAVIAR! This suppose to be their signature appetizer and I have to say it is Excellent!! Refreshing and light and  Truffle Oil!! CAVIAR!!Services is attentive and professional. Great Food! Great Value! Lunch Specials ROCKS!"

The name just keep on coming across my ears for years; but for some reason, I just never ended up there. We're not completely sure what made us go there, but we decided to go there to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.I had the truffle soup for my starter and it was up to standard. It was creatively served with pumpkin veloute; I think they match well. Le wife had ""Floating island of champignons de Paris"" which is basically consomme, with thinly sliced mushrooms. It was disappointing tbh. The dish was completely lacking and just too plain.The second course was the star of the night. I had the scampi carpaccio, cream, caviar and it just blew my mind. I'm a fan of a simple-dish-done-well and this dish was executed to perfection. The ingredients were fresh and the cream compliments the caviar perfectly without overpowering it. Le wife had what I think was their signature dish, the cold angel hair with caviar. It's not a unique dish, but again, the execution was spot on.The third dish was decent. I'm a big fan of prawn so I decided to go for the carabinero gambas, which is basically those red prawns from the Mediterranean Sea. It was not the best one that I've ever had, but it was still ok. It was slightly overcooked for me, and there was some tomato risotto that just felt out of place. Le wife had bamboo clam with black truffle.The main course was another dish that I love. We shared the roasted rack of pata negra pig. At first bites, I thought it was just a mediocre pork chop. But the after taste of the pork was just superb, I feel like this is a very deep and mature dish that you just can't stop eating. Heck, I even took 1/2 of my wife's pork!The dessert was also great. We shared the apple tart a la dragees. It's a very thin and crispy apple pie. It was a little bit too sweet to my taste, but it didn't stop me from finishing them.Overall, I'd definitely be back to Gunther's. I heard they have a great lunch deal but even without it, a future visit to Gunther's is imminent."

If a decision to give a customer and each of his guests what they wanted to eat required top manager approval then I was obviously talking to the wrong restaurant.I took a chance and hosted the dinner at Gunther's.

They start by bringing around a cart of some of the ingredients they have in house, truffles, tiger prawns, wagyu, etc...a bit of an unnecessary show if you ask me. I sampled the chilli prawn as a starter, it was presented nicely but lacked flavor...especially considering some of the flavorful cooking methods Singaporeans use for tiger prawns!My main entree was the special wagyu. The wagyu was good quality, a little fatty for my liking but still pretty good.

This restaurant has merited positive reviews for its angel hair pasta, so I had to try one of those. I ordered the Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar and was not disappointed. The pasta was cooked to al dente and seasoned generously with truffle oil, and finally topped with Oscietra Caviar. The amazing flavor of the seasoning coupled with the bounciness of the pasta made it a satisfying dish. For dessert, the Canele from the Petit four was outstanding. It is a bite-sized snack in perfect proportions, and is crispy on the outside and chewy inside; a good finale to the meal."

My dad used to do takeaways when the stall was still at Hill Street Hawker Centre so this is pretty much my benchmark of how duck should be.The dark sauce in which the duck is simmered in is always slightly on the saltier side but I am not one to complain about that. What I like best about Heng Gi is that the meat is always tender and tasty - I usually avoid having duck because most stalls aren't good at getting this right. Here, the duck is served up with soft beancurd and braised eggs, topped with sprigs of coriander and a bowl of steaming white rice - probably in the running for the last meal I would want to have. Oh! Not to forget the chilli because I think that is what seals the deal for this stall. Smashed chilli with garlic mixed with vinegar acts as the perfect dip for the fragrant salty duck meat. Sells out in a blink of an eye so make sure you get there before 2pm!"

This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although the Char Kway Teow was good here, I don't think the massive line represents how good it was in regards to others we went to and isn't always a measure of quality.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.Although the flavours balanced very well, the Wok Hei wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and this lacked that substance and pow that you get when the Wok Hei is infused to perfection. Given Hill Streets Kway Teow's reputation and a glimpse of how good it could be from my taste, I'll be back again to confirm whether it was an ""off"" day or not but with a 20 minute line, if it's not stellar next time, I won't be back.Cheers!Dave."

Let's get that right out of the way. So much so, that I've spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. Obviously my homemade version isn't as good, but with some tweaks I think it could be a passable substitute. Here is where the wheels fall off the wagon. It's cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it's received. On our first attempt, we waited for about 1.25 hours and only moved 4 tiles (we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go) which was not much. We gave up.We returned the next morning 30 minutes before opening and received number `11`. If you guys are missing a number `11`, I might know why. It was another hour wait before we got our food -- this time we were determined; which was delicious as I've mentioned. The whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of Singaporean weather was just lost on me. Yes the food was delicious. Yes it was cheap. But for a Michelin star you have to do something above and beyond. I feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over Singapore, you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha.. It's the challenge that Yelp and Michelin diners face -- seek these places out! Find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent. Blaze the trail for others to follow. Don't just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective. You might find something you really like... A diamond in the rough."

I planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported. Arrived at 5pm and there was a queue but tolerable. Waited 30 minutes for my food. A good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you. Multiply by 2 as each is likely ordering for 2 people. Then multiply by 2 again as it takes 2 mins to prepare a bowl of noodles. So # of people in front of you * 4 = average wait time. Is it worth waiting more than 30 mins? I don't think so. The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good. There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything. A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom. Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs. My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time."

After roughly 2 hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles, we finally got our orders in.And let me say this. The wait was totally worth it. The noodles were hand pulled, very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base. There was a wide selection of minced pork, liver, sliced pork, wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl. Plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours. The combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite. Crunchy, savoury, sour and spicy. Definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good, especially with the pricing being $8 for medium."

Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait. The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6.

I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like ""I'll come back one day"". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!"

Pretty good time if you ask me.This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing! The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good! Comes with a cup of liver/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters.

I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins."

In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost.  The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor.  The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers. Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish.  After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know.  In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold."

Out of all the dishes my favorite was the meatballs, because the juice of the meat seemingly burst as you bite into it, the pork flavors fills your palates as it travels.  The only thing is the line is terrible, I personally wouldn't stand in line again."

Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special. If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass."

Definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders. Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line. It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it.  You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though. The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me. There isn't a lot of meat but most dishes don't come with a lot of meat in south east Asia. We also got the meatball soup! Yummy! I would definitely come back as long as I could avoid the lines.

And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1/4 mile NE of Raffles) that, in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.It was fortunate that I had written down ""bak chor mee"" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile."

If in a group, please remember to order per bowl. so don't go like ""2 bowls of $5 mee pok, no chill"" - you will be left #ignored. When your bowl is presented to you, you will be glad you actually waited. the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee. you have the minced pork, the liver slices, the singluar meatball, that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop. Mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite. The accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like!

I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here.Um sadly. Wasn't impressed.I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted.I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day.Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm."

One of the best parts of this is how well cooked their minced and sliced pork is - soo tender and juicy considering how fine they are. The pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it, and to crown it off, they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish, which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl. One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination!

Today took us to the Tiong Bahru Market, which I will say I enjoy much better than the Maxwell Center the day before - much more spacious, more seating, etc. Hong Heng is easy to find as it's the first place to the left once you go up the escalator to the second floor. The line moves relatively quickly, and ordering is simple: you can order a small, medium, or large portion, for S$3 at the smallest and moving up S$1 for each larger size. The serving isn't anything fancy - just a whole bunch of noodles on a flat plate (maybe a bowl would be a better way to serve), along with a small amount of spice on the side, as we requested it to be a bit more mild.I'm not sure if it's the oil/broth that the noodles are cooked in, but wow - we wolfed this plate down as fast as humanly possible. They were so good and flavorful, and while some noodles (Asian, Italian pasta, or otherwise) can get a bit messy when they are inundated with liquid, these noodles were just filled with juicy, prawn-based goodness. The main drawback, surprisingly for me (as I'm not a fan of shrimp), is that we got 2 measly pieces of shrimp in the entire plate. We did order a small, but given the generous portion size on the noodles, I would have anticipated a bit more seafood.All in all, though, I really enjoyed the noodles here. There's a Bib Gourmand sticker on the stall, and IMO it is well-earned and deserved. Sometimes really good food can be simply done, and that is the way it certainly ends up here at Hong Heng."

The noodles are really fried here, unlike many stalls that just give it a little stir and serve it to you. The effort put into cooking up this brilliant plate of hokkien mee is evidenced by the great care taken by the uncle as he fries up a storm to ensure that the noodles take up the slightly charred flavour from the wok. The stock used is very flavourful, giving the noodles the fresh full flavour of prawns. They are also pretty generous with their prawns and sotongs and the seafoods served up are always fresh.

The standout for me is the fried wonton skins. At first seemingly extraneous given its just fried wonton wrappers without any filling, they lend the dish a nice texture contrast. The only drawback for me was the sauce. I prefer mine to be on the  vinegary side and Hup Hup uses a good deal of tomato ketchup.

The location is a bit odd - its tucked away upstairs in a strange part of the hotel. I recommended just asking someone who works there for directions. My only complain is that the restrooms are outside the restaurant, adjacent to the event space for the hotel. The night we were there it was some kind of prom (?) so the restrooms were chaotic and filled with loud teenagers, while the restaurant was a peaceful, elegant affair. It did make me laugh. :-)Make reservations early - its a small space. You wont be disappointed!"

I started with tune tartare on avocado, and it was well-executed, smoky and ocean-tasting enough. I then had the carabineros rice, which was thinly sliced raw carabinero prawns on a red risotto, which must have had some of the tomalley cooked in. This was not to my taste - the bite of the rice was too al dente for me. I had the wagyu flank for the third course, and I did like this, but it was two miserly cubes... Sadness. Dessert rounded off the meal - mango and a coconut sorbet. While it was yummy, it was nothing special.We also had the petit fours which were some macarons and jellies.My favorite bit of the meal was actually the amuse bouche, which included a tomato meringue sandwiching some cheese and basil (meant to be a Caprese salad), which completely surprised me as I bit into it, with its tanginess and complete rounding of flavors from a tiny morsel. What I would have loved to see more of this innovative spirit.I do have to qualify my review, with the fact that the Iggy's chef has now changed, and I had this meal in December 2016 (yes I know my review is a wee bit late)."

However, the price point is insanely high for flavors that you can find at other a la carte restaurants and for that reason, I would not recommend Iggy's for that perfect date night or family dinner unless you've already tried all the rest of the top SG restaurants and are looking for something new. You are spending the same amount that you would at the likes of Andre, Corner House and Jaan to say the least, each of which provides a very unique experience that you would get ONLY if you went to those particular restaurants - going beyond the ""pay to eat at a fancy restaurant"" mentality but rather to leave you remembering it. Nevertheless, I did enjoy Iggy's but the price point is just too high for the lack of an experience.Iggy's and Les Amis are the last two of the stupid Asia Top 50 List I haven't tried in Singapore so wanted to have a bite at Iggy's.You walk into a dramatic doorway that I thought was really cool followed by a long dark hallway and into a very small dining room with 6 fairly small although comfortable tables. They have a good number of staff so you know you should be well taken care of (they wear their 5 Star Forbes pins prominently). You receive the tasting menu options which you pick either the Gastronomic full 5 course tasting or the smaller 3 course (I believe) as well as the wine/drink iPad. The wine list was very French wine heavy and I felt was lacking as was their cocktail and drink menu. We did do a ""half bottle"" of a nice Spanish Tempranillo, however, where instead of opening a half bottle of wine, they use their Coravin device - something I feel is more appropriate for doing high end wine by the glass rather than saying you are selling a ""half bottle."" Felt a bit ripped off.We opted for the full Gastronomic Menu and were presented with the following:- Snacks - you get a few pre courses which include a platter with a bunch of charcoal stones where only two are edible. Some kind of potato which was cool but a bit bland of flavor. Then was a sea urchin cone which I thought was a bit fishy (we are big uni fans in any sushi restaurant). Then you get a pretty good oyster covered in squid ink snack. Lastly there was a nice soba noodle topped with caviar and lemongrass that you eat in a single bite along with either a foie gras fried ball or a fried ebi ball (if you don't like foie gras like me).- Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio - Loved the flavor although something seemed off. I felt that I'm not the biggest fan of how the watermelon and scallop were the same room temperature together but it was beautifully presented and it was a nice concept.- Purple Asparagus - Nice dish and beautifully presented- Smoked Spanish Mackerel - This is served with crab risotto and bonito ""ash"" or powder. I was very happy with this dish and for sure would be something I would order a la carte. Even though I loved this dish, the flavor was not anything revolutionary - it was a nicely done fish on top of risotto.- For the main course you have the option of a rabbit stew ($225), lamb ($250) or Hida Waygu Striploin ($275) where I'm sure the majority of people would opt for the latter and better sounding option. We did that and we were definitely happy with that option. We loved it.- For dessert they had a pretty incredible looking ""Strawberry"" - a huge red sugar coated and crafted strawberry looking thing that was REALLY COOL. Inside of this thing (see picture) was milk ice cream, shiso and tomato. That's where my problem was - why for a beautiful creation like this that's supposed to be that perfect dessert would you have TOMATO AND SHISO??? Something was off about it and that was exactly it. Cool idea except if it's called Strawberry, I was expecting a really cool Strawberries and Cream that didn't come to surface.-They had a second dessert which was really cool and was a jackfruit ice cream sandwich which I thought was really nice and creative. Love when restaurants use local ingredients and flavors.Fortunately I didn't get any of those courses that I saw from previous Yelpers that looked like someone randomly through a bunch of crap on a dish randomly and presented it as a course. All of my courses were very nicely presented.Coffee and tea are included in the meal which was another cool perk.Service was great and I had no issues with the environment or tableware as another has mentioned. It was very comfortable.I enjoyed myself during this meal but for this price point, I really would not recommend Iggy's. It just wasn't memorable as other Yelpers mentioned. It will be interesting to see what Michelin does with this one next month."

Iggy's has about 10 tables and half these tables were empty--it felt as if I was dining in a deserted restaurant...or a library. There was no music! Hence, Manfriend and I felt like we needed to whisper the entire meal. We ordered the gastronomic 7 course...meh. Out of the 7 dishes, we only enjoyed 2. The first was the burrata with tomato and the second was a striploin, flown in from Japan. You cant' go wrong with these dishes...all the others, the sea urchin, foie gras, tile fish, snacks...forgettable. For a meal over $700, I expected much better."

I expect the staffs to note this inappropriate behavior and would ask the guy to take his phone call outside. It's like would you take a call during the movies? I expect a story for each dish but got a generic summary of the list of ingredients. For example, the garden plate had 20 vegetables imported from Japan. Each vegetable was scattered throughout the plate. Was I suppose to mix the vegetable w/the watermelon burrata gazpacho? Or, eat each vegetable individually? If I should eat each vegetable individually, where do I start? Presentation for this dish was a hot mess (see pic).Next dish: uni w/seared scallop green pea soup. The protein in this dish was good by itself but the pea consume broth fell flat. The slimy texture from the eggplant and the blanched peas was a bad combination put together. Onto Iggy's signature dish is the Cappellini with sakura ebi. Nothing UMAMI about this dish except that is was under season. Final dish is the duo wagyu with the poached squid ink egg and black truffle. This was the only dish that was good, and was gastronomist for the '$275 gastronomist' prefix dinner. The Japanese and Australian wagyu were cooked well, and I admire the skilled to deep fry a poached egg in squid ink. The shaved truffle enhanced the natural flavors of the beef.The gratin lychee Japanese melon dessert was better than the main dessert. The main dessert reminded me of a blood splatter scene from Dexter (see pic). Overall, save yourself the money and book elsewhere. Or, treat yourself to a Hermes bracelet. Bad planning on my part."

Maybe its was the wrong occasion - we came here for Valentine's day. The menu was different from their normal tasting. It was six courses, tho we couldn't find some of the classics, such as the ""rock potatoes"" on the menu. Here are the six courses:1. Snacks 2. Double belly (raw toro belly + pork belly)3. Lobster ravioli4. Mackerel and brussel sprouts5. Wagyu duo (Japanese and Australian)6. Dessert - Red hot molten passion.One thing I noticed in many dishes is their love for playing with the texture. For example, one of the snacks consisted of jello(I think cucumber?), avocado, and crab meat. A very similar combination was repeated later in the meal. The cooking method in most dishes are more traditional and classic, we didn't get much foamy, decomposed, or reconstituted ingredients. In terms of highlights during the meal, for me they were the double belly and double wagyu. I might be biased because toro and pork belly are two of my favorite things in the world. The pork belly dish came out in a wrapped up plastic bag, a specially material that can withstand up to 200 degree of heat. To taste, they first cut into the bag to let the aroma out. With black truffle, asparagus, and a clear chicken broth, the aroma truly stimulate your senses. The other dishes were a bit lackluster. Their homemade ravioli wasn't thin enough, the mackerel was a bit salty and nothing special. The other thing we didn't like was their pace of serving. Interval between courses were very short that we feel like we constantly have food in front of us. I am having a hard time justify the cost of the meal. For the same price (or a bit higher), we used to find much worthier meals in the States - Alinea, Eleven Madison, Le Bernadin. Not sure if we will be back."

Singapore is quite a gastronomic juggernaut in Asia. You can sample various local food (drawing from the influences of China, Malaysia and India) in the so-called hawker centers around the city, and the presence of affluent people means that there are also quite a few high-end places featuring unique haute cuisine. My first stop was a lunch at Iggy's, which has long been one of the top restaurants in Singapore. Located at Hilton Hotel, Iggy's features globally influenced cuisine drawing inspirations from Europe and Japan. Overall, I had a pleasant meal at the restaurant.For lunch, you can go with three-course menu (starting at S$85 per person), four-course menu (starting at S$105 per person) or go all-out with signature tasting menu (starting at S$105 per person). I opted for the four-course menu, which consists of tuna tartare, spaghettini, a main course of pork, wagyu or lamb and a dessert (the restaurant had three options to choose from). The first course of tuna tartare started out with a bang. I was startled to see the smoke emanating from the mascarpone cheese that accompanied the dish, but the cold texture was quite unique and worked fabulously with tuna. Spaghettini that came with crab and tomato was an above-average pasta dish that had very nice balance of flavor. The main courses were somewhat underwhelming, although by no means bad. My brother and I ordered wagyu and lamb, each accompanied by grilled vegetables of shiitake, potato, nanohana, tomato and lotus root. While wagyu was very nicely cooked, I felt the seasoning was somewhat uneven. Lamb, on the other hand, had texture that was tougher than I had expected. For desserts, we proceeded to share berry & berries that came with cheese, milk and cherry, a very light and refreshing dish, and kaya & the tarik with Ceylon tea flavored ice cream that was quite pleasant and soothing. The restaurant has a formal but not stuffy vibe with professionally dressed and attentive staff. There are some nice wine selections (although I was surprised to see the stiff price for a glass, which runs at around S$30 per glass). Overall, Iggy's had some nice dishes with unique gastronomic concepts and deserves a visit when you are in Singapore."

Came here for my bday dinner celebration with hubby, but we should've just revisited Jaan instead. We opted for the Gastronmic Menu at $275/person (the menu can be found online), and other than the ""burnt oyster' dish, everything else on the course menu was uncreative and just not. that. good.enough. for a restaurant of its standing.  We probably had similar and better dishes at casual restaurants. Located in a run-down hilton hotel next to Far East Plaza, the location is meh, though the interior decor of the place was private and classy and perfect for a special celebration. and this is not a big deal, but i didn't like it that the bathroom was located OUTSIDE of the restaurant to be shared with other hotel visitors. You charge fine dining price, and while I will not expect a towel lady to be present to hand out my hand towels as they do in many of Seoul/New York fine dining, I expect the bathroom to be inside the restaurant, easily acessibie, and with similar classy decor. Other turn-offs:-I told the waitress no-alcohol in any of the dishes for personal reasons. She said Plum Soda in one of the dishes has alcohol in it, and that she'd have it replaced with something else. And yet, there it was, Plum Soda along with my other dish. The waitress quickly apologized and brought out another dish. -Our wagyu was not tender; it was tough and chewy.-The waiter that explains each of our courses changed each time. Sometimes it was a girl, then it was a guy, then it was another guy, and most of the time, I couldn't really make out what they were saying. The girl was more helpful than the men that served us, though.-It was obvious they forgot it was my birthday, although my hubby stated it in the email exchanges in making our reservation. When my husband asked for the check and finally asked about the whereabouts, the waiter lied and said it'll be out in another minute. After we get our check, really? At least be honest about it. Then I go see him talking to another waiter in a hurry, and it took another 15 min for us just waiting around for them to bring out some pathetic little chocolate ball they called a bday dessert with a lit candle. Fail.-Not a big deal, but their bread and chocolate selections are not expansive. and they only come around once. Yes I really miss the real fine dining back at home. Finally, one thing that really annoys me about Singapore's fine dining in genereal is that they are so stingy with their portions and they nickel and dime you. Portion-wise, I understand. This is Asia and I don't expect you to fully satisfy me as New York fine dining does for their diners truly looking for a dining experience (though you charge as expensive). But the fact that they come over during mid-meal and ask us if we'd either like Coffee or Tea, and THEN CHARGE US for it (not sure how much, around 8~15 per cup?) is beyond ridiculous. I ordered a course meal and in that, a tea and/or coffee should be included, as it is in all the other fine dining I've tried across America and Korea. We got hit with their sneaky tactic last time at another Singapore fine dining so we made sure to ask if it was complimentary, which it wasn't. Pretty sad that they try to nickel and dime you when it's usually something that accomapnies desserts in course meals. Or seriously, don't come over randomly and ask me if i want something if you are going to charge me for it.Iggy's was supposely voted one of the top 50 best restaurants in Asia, and prior to our dinner we were wondering why it hadn't earned a Michelin yet.

There are other little surprises that you'll encounter through the meal that play with your expectations and ideas of what a dish should be like, but I won't spoil any of the other surprises here.Service was actually a little lacklustre here, staff weren't incredibly well versed in their wine list, there were little lapses in attention, but at Iggy's the food often makes up for any shortfall anywhere else. Expect to have your tastebuds tickled and your senses toyed with, but do not expect that any complexity of flavour or execution of technique will be compromised as a result. Everything at Iggy's is elegantly done, and even with the dinner costing over $400 a head, we still felt it was very much worth it."

I was extremely lucky to be given a lunch treat at Iggy's last Thursday, and I'm glad to say that it lived up to the expectations. The decor is all slick black and very minimalistic. The staff is present but not in your face. The 4-course menu offers good variety, though I find it quite meat-centric. We started with an amuse bouche of Tomato Essence, with foam of tomato, tomato concasse & tomato/bell pepper cream. It was smooth, refreshing and flavoursome. I had the Gillardeau Oysters with Caviar, and my friend had the Foie Gras. Both were truly sublime. Main courses were Wagyu with Madeira Sauce and I had the Pigeon with Lentils, very classic. The pigoen is well cooked, though I find the accompaniment of cooked beetroot and beetroot puree a little on the sweet-side. Dessert of Kaya & Teh Tarik was a little disappointing. The dish was somehow a little disjointed. My Forest Berries with Campari jelly, blood orange sorbet with mascarpone was on the other hand, very balanced flavours.Having eaten in other restaurants in that list in Europe, it's hard not to compare. However, would it be fair? Probably not. The cooking is definitely well executed and service is faultless. Plus the fact that they served a really yummy sparkling sake that was delicious with the oysters. I would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant."

Imperial treasure restaurants are great in maintaining consistencies and great food at fair prices. This is definitely one of my favorites in the chain (their super Peking duck at Paragon tops this for me). Soup dumpling (the Xiao long baos) are the best in the city (in my opinion!) beautifully thin translucent skin, wrapped around a sweet rich meaty broth and meat. It's even better than those in the famed Ding-tai-fengs. The other ala carte dishes are mostly great.

I believe it might be the (or second to) the top tier in terms of marketing and pricing in the group - and all are darnably enjoyable to dine in.they have an eye for intimate, cosy, dark spaces - lit enough in white light so you get to see your food, but dark enough for a bit of comfortable chatting. this one here also has wooden pod-like booths on the perimeter that seem good enough for four (maybe less if you order as much as we do) and are rather aesthetically gorgeous.it certainly doesn't hurt that the food is delicious too, like our starters of jellyfish head (I almost always order this - and definitely order it if they serve up the head, which is satisfyingly crunchier than the tentacles) and julienned vegetables. both had a good dose of sesame oil and the right amount of salt - and such textures: crunchy jellyfish and fresh crisp greens.the beef dish that followed was silky, tender beef sauteed with even silkier softened lees - and so good. I have to say though, that we've never been disappointed by beef at the imperial treasure restaurants - it's always tender without any mushy, beefy without any gaminess, and softly chewy without gristle.while my parents were having their double-boiled soups (always a god order), I took a leap of faith with this sauteed eel dish - and landed safely with eel slivers stir-fried in a dark savory sauce, topped with minced fresh garlic.eel is a very fishy fish, and skin on - as it was here - its flavor can be rather prominent/ pungent. both words can be applied to minced fresh garlic too, but the two complemented/ tempered harmoniously. still a strong-tasting dish (best with rice), but with enough exoticism and tastiness to try.two more: soft yellow cabbage braised with yunnan ham, and young peas with bouncy fresh shrimp.completely opposite spectrums in terms of taste and texture, but I'd be hard pressed to pick one over the other.and, we finished with three desserts.osmanthus jelly, fragrant and lightly perfumed, and dotted through with plump wolfberries.red bean pancake, crisp with a thin layer of bean paste and barely greasy (which is quite a feat for this dish).and according to my sister, the best pumpkin pancake ever. it's actually a nian gao (chinese sticy rice cake, or chinese new year cake) colored orange with pumpkin, and pan-fried. I actually couldn't taste the pumpkin, but it was certainly a good specimen of its class regardless - and came thin enough so it doesn't get cloying.it's obvious I like the food eh? so I leave you with the photos - and a recommendation to visit as soon as you can. great for dates, for family meals and business dining - and it's seldom one place is appropriate for all three."

Of all of the French restaurants I have been to located in Cali, NYC, Vegas and France they all have many different types and varieties of bread.

I guess that's what you get for being a single diner. And oh by the way...I'm pretty sure I had more drinks, and a better menu selection than that couple...so if you think of it as a price per person per table ratio...I'm pretty sure I had them beat, and I could have had a better view with my average meal.Several other window side tables were empty up until I had my last few courses, so I was baffled on how they manage the table system.Bitter much?

Hard, with words.Best start at the beginning.I booked some weeks ago, the occasion being my hubbies birthday. In my first inquiry I also stated that I'd love a window table which wasn't available any longer - we would be kept on the waiting list.Also, they offered a complimentary birthday cake and I was able to chose up to 4 words on it.The entire booking process was very smooth, once I chose a menu (3 menus available, you have to choose one of them per table beforehand), I gave our dietary requirements and the wording on the cake, I had also asked about dress code (men with long trousers- jeans are ok - and long sleeved shirts, ladies elegant), and my contact Patricia was very professional and friendly.When I arrived on the night, prior to my husband, I was welcomed by Patricia - so nice seeing my email-contact in person, she was lovely - and led to a window table, yay! (Surprise! was her reaction :-))My husband arrived and we ordered champagne by the glass, received the amuse bouche, followed by choosing a white wine. This being the only element of the night I wasn't too pleased with as it did not taste at all like the sommelier described - but that's subjective and did not diminish the overall experience.The pace at which the 5 course menu was then served suited us fine: faster in the beginning and slower toward the end. We were famished and devoured the bread offered so we were glad for food arriving smoothly.The food.. a feast for the eyes every single time, and quite a show as well (dry ice helps) - with the items on each plate being arranged in the perfect order, to be scooped up just as is - for the most delectable combination of flavour and aromas.I have seldom had such a combination of different cooking styles (fermentation, slow cooking, raw food..) that went so well together.Personally, I do not believe much in overly ""experimental"" or molecular cooking as I want to eat properly when I'm hungry and enjoy great quality combined with creative excellency, as is the case with chef Kirk Westaway's cooking.Oh, and chef stepped out of the kitchen to present dessert himself, spraying warm chocolate mousse (to die for) into a 'variation of chocolate' bowl, asking everyone how they liked their food. Needless to say, my hubbies' birthday cake, which was served at the end, was most delectable - we had it at home the next day.I cannot wait for the next occasion that justifies the expense for an evening at JAAN :-)"

He spins fairytales. His attention to details, the subtlety and balance in his pretty dishes, the overall ebb and flow, ups and downs, and then that happily ever after that ended on the perfect note.. Needless to say, i was won over dish after dish during my 4 hour long 10 course dinner. Julien may be the punchy one, but you'll never get sick of Kirk and you'd want more of his dishes.The first serving of Wagyu beef tartare, with a clever ""Fish & Chips"" (done a la French fine dining), a foie gras and truffle macaron (salty, creamy, sweet and chewy), and an olive cracker with olive purée and cheddar cheese (superbly crumbly). You know this Briton has a sense of humor with this French rendition of English food.Then came the best onion brioche i've tasted. Those layers and that subtle onion flavor..From the land, we dived right into the ocean with the Majestic Irish Oyster (from Donegal) with Artichoke cream, and 'Oscietra' caviar. Loved the creamy, plump and firm texture of the Irish oyster, which was balanced with the slightly nutty Artichoke cream. And then you have those pops of the sea as the caviar bursts. Then it was back to more refreshing bites with the Tomato Collection. Kirk took the humble tomato and cheese dish and elevated it to typical JAAN standard. The many flavors are coaxed from the vine-ripened heirloom tomato- first cooked sous vide in a tomato consommé to intensify its flavours, then stuffed with a mixture of cubed Oxheart tomatoes, gherkins, capers and oregano. It was then restored to its original shape by the process of dehydrating and rehydrating the fruit. The supporting basil sorbet, green basil and mimolette cheese pesto, Japanese tomato berries, olive soil, burrata brought out the intense sweetness of the tomato, by providing a refreshing song in the background. This is the most sophisticated and complicated tomato I've eaten. Another gorgeous plate was the Farmer's Harvest with Hand Dived Scottish Scallop, a dish that changes with the season. A combination of sous vide and roasted, blanched, baked, pickled, pureed, grilled root and leafy seasonal vegetables provided the different textures and that Carrasco ham added a nutty salty balance for that meaty flavor. There is just so many evolving layers on 1 plate! Of course the perfectly seared scallops contribute to the meatiness of this dish. A short break later and bam. Kirk hits home with comfort and stability with the Line Caught John Dory served with crayfish tail, fava beans, broad beans, clams and pea puree. The dish is finished with a pea velouté poured tableside. I felt stuffed but i couldn't help but finish every bit of this perfectly browned fish. This is almost an Asian dish i feel. The Roasted Venison Saddle was the most heavy handed dish of the lot but the meal peaks here. A New Zealand venison is served medium rare, with celeriac ribbons that have been blanched in wholegrain mustard emulsion, pear glazed in port sauce, pear chutney and celeriac puree. Ah such lovely Christmas flavors. I thought it was a tad salty for me though. Dessert song with a lilt. High again on the Ivory Caramel, an out of this world chocolate dessert made with 45% Michel Cluizel white chocolate, flourless chocolate sponge with tempered chocolate sheets are joined by French caramelised hazelnuts and sous vide Aero chocolate."

Currently lead by Chef de Cuisine Kirk Westway, Jaan offers elevated modern french cuisine with imaginative twists and beautiful aesthetics. I visited this establishment with Miss M in September 2015 as a celebration for both of our birthdays.This restaurant had been on my to-go list for a very long time. Having only 40 seats in the dining room, it was quite a challenge to get a reservation in their restaurant. During my previous visit to Singapore, I had tried calling them up to reserve a table one week in advance, but it was fully booked. So during my subsequent trip, I've made sure to e-mail them about one month in advance.Located on the 70th floor of Equinox Complex, entering the restaurant is an experience by itself. There is a booth at the ground floor that leads the way to an elevator up to the restaurant. After passing through several short hallways, we entered the restaurant and were lucky enough to be seated at a table with a spectacular view that oversees the Marina Bay Sands. The set up of the dining room felt really special with its bright, classy interior at such a high elevation. This was by far the most romantic restaurant I've ever been.Dining at Jaan was one of the best fine dining experiences I've had so far. At a very affordable price point of $118, I would say that their lunch degustation was more than worth it. However, be mindful that they have an additional charge for their amuse bouche which was automatically included in our lunch.Their stand out dishes were the heirloom tomato collection and their rosemary infused organic egg. I can't praise them enough for the creativity and artistry demonstrated in all of their dishes. All of their plates looked so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. All these factors combined, along with excellent service, lead to a very enjoyable meal."

Writing about Jaan on here is like doing so for Andre, almost every review written is much better than what I can ever write.Nik T., Birgit W, and many others definitely do a great job putting an experience identical to my own into words. It was a very surprising and highly impressive experience...and I was there for Valentine's Day! Foodwise, it was great and again I think others do a great job in putting the menu into words. So instead I will write about my experience.I was expecting a typical boring French restaurant that you'd find in London, NYC and other cities that are pretentious and uninspiring with your traditional pigeon, foie gras, sea bass, etc but was pleasantly surprised from beginning to end where Chef Kirk Hathaway did a hell of an amazing job putting together a menu of creative and tasteful delights. Yes he did use those boring ingredients I mentioned but in a very unique way with a new flavor than that I've ever had before.The view also can't be beat and you gotta do your best to get a table with the view.Only downsides - the biggest is the wine list. It's weak and lacks a lot of depth. I hate the iPad wine list too and I hope these high end restaurants (French Laundry and Per Se included) start getting rid of it. One of the coolest and more impressive things about restaurants is if they bring out a brick of a wine list binder - everyone always goes WOW by it. Not a dirty iPad that God knows how many people touched. Also, I'm not sure if the French guy is the sommelier but he didn't do much with suggestions or even offering to pour our expensive bottle of wine into a decanter (it needed it). I hope this was a Valentine's Day thing only since it was busy, but there was no one there to pour the wine even after multiple requests (it was on a separate table since there was no room on our table) when our glasses were empty.Second is that I wish they only staff servers that know the food courses inside and out and are passionate about it. There were a few courses where the server would come out and recite what was memorized and quickly leave which was pretty annoying for a place like that, especially if I can't understand their accent.Otherwise, everything was perfect and made for one memorable Valentine's Day. The staff really was very kind and made everything that we want happen for us. The main server who was running around still was a total rockstar. One of the greatest parts was that Chef Kirk actually came out and greeted us with one of the desserts. We chatted for a good while about a number of topics. It was awesome. I hope other restaurants start adopting this personal touch.Highly recommend for that special someone or a great family dinner. Book at least a week in advance or maybe you'll get lucky if booking later and on a weekday. Totally deserves the best!"

I must say that I also had some fears about how the service would be as it was an annoying experience booking with them - they required as to pre-select which menu we wanted (they offered three options: 5-Course Degustation Menu at S$198++ per person, -      7-Course Prestige Menu at S$238++ per person and 10-Course Gastronomic Menu at S$298++ per person) as well as providing scanned copies of the credit card. To me just ridiculous to have such processes in place but anyway after some discussions with them managed to reach a solution. Our group had opted for the 7-course menu and as I am not always a fan of seafood I had asked for that to be excluded from the menu.In a sense it is a really nice location with beautiful views over Singapore but the design of the place is weird and does not at all look stylish or classy and to me at also lacks charm and warmth so would hope they redecorate. Upon arriving we were asked if we wanted a drink to start with - as is too often the case we were not presented with any menu but rather just a mention of a few of the options without any prices mentioned. Had to specifically ask to see the wine list and then saw that many of the wines had insane mark-ups even for Singaporean standards. We settled on a half-bottle of Champagne to split as we just wanted a small glass before dinner. While we were then still studying the wine list and the options the first dishes started coming in. No problem for us but when we were then ready to order wine for the meal the surprise came. One person the table wanted the wine pairing and was then told it was impossible as he had already eaten the first dish - he said it was fine Just serve that wine now and he will still drink it but the staff insisted it was not possible as it was a wine pairing. Luckily the sommelier saw that we were not really happy at this point and came over and asked if she could help and then she quickly said it is of course not a problem. Still not the type of service expected at this sort of place.The waitress we had actually was a bit off as she put out the cutlery on the table on the correct side of the plate for three of us but constantly reversed it for the fourth person at the table (the same person who she refused to let order the wine pairing). Otherwise the service was fine but at nice restaurants it is the little things that should also stand out.The food was ranging from very good to excellent but interestingly enough the replacement dishes I received not wanting fish and seafood were by far the best dishes and left the others at the table jealous. Looking at the price level of Jaan (the bill with wine, food, coffee/tea came to around 600 SGD per person) it was not at all as good as expected and it pales in comparison with some of the other top restaurants in Asia (thinking the likes of L'effervesence, Takazawa, Narisawa, Issaya Siamese Club, Gaggan, Eat Me and Nahm) and clearly with similar restaurants in both Europe and the US so I was a but underwhelmed. I am not saying that it was bad but just not good enough and I am not even ranking this as one of the best places in Singapore so while perfectly acceptable I will not visit again as there are so many other better places."

It was a perfect birthday dinner surprise dinner by my hubby.They're known for their pigeon meat- I tried for the first time and I'm not sure what to think of it. It's tender and tastes like chicken, but it's pigeon. My mind and palette were going at each other and my conclusion is that it was delish and at least i've tried it once in my life and not sure if I'd try again. I'm an adventurous eater but eating a pigeon was a bit too much. All other dishes were made to perfection and I loved each and every one of their 14 course meals! Hopefully I'll return again soon!"

All the dishes were beautifully presented and the innovative and complex tastes really pushed our taste buds to the limit. The service was also impeccable. This is what fine dining should be and there is nothing more that I can ask for.They have an extremely good for value lunch menu of $58 for 3 courses or $88 for 5 courses.

You probably ask, ""What is that supposed to mean?"" What I mean is that many of the dishes were drawn with complex and varied textures and flavors that did not merge into a coherent and meaningful whole. Consider the salad: olive oil nodules, freshly warmed berry, wilted field greens, heirloom carrot, etc. Every element was done with great detail. But in the end, it was all sorted onto the plate like a pile (well, curved like a J).  The flavors run all over each other, and there isn't a core experience of what these flavors are together supposed to create in your mouth.  Except for the amuse bouche (the mushroom tea in a bodum shot glass)--other dishes were the same. There also was no real theme to the meal that I could understand.  The beef was excellently cooked, and served with a fine risotto.  But the beef and the risotto don't seem to balance and complement each other at all.  It seemed like there was so much excellent technique, but when all was said and done the parts of the meal do not sum to anything greater than these several parts.  I had expected much better for the venue, the hype, and the price.Separately about service, we could not stomach the oysters. We even made a point to mention to the server that we thought they were bad when she asked, but she made no effort to find out what we meant or to rectify it. If I'm asked why I did not eat something, then I hope you will try to understand what I said and act on it. Otherwise, please do not ask."

Falling into a fiercely competitive Uber restaurant category that has it's mainstays with 14 course dinners, finest ingredients, best service, culinary technique and as a result high prices. The restaurants I can compare it to are Alinea and True from Chicago and although it was the most expensive dinner my wife and I have ever had it could not measure up to these giants of culinary excellence. Don't get me wrong, it's still an amazing place, so let me start with what I liked.It holds a breath-taking view at the top of the Singapore Swiss Otel. From this lofty perch it commands a view of the surrounding city as well as Marina bay. The ceiling has glass plates resembling mother of pearl giving you the impression there is a sort of origami clam shell floating above you. Both food and drinks have a wow factor. I got a sort of egg white, apricot Bellini with the most delightful hard whipped foam on top. Food taste was excellent, using the best ingredients in the most delightful combinations. Some dishes had excellent presentation namely the amuse bouche was perhaps one of the largest and best presentations I've had. It came on a mix of holders; some rock, others bamboo and had a sauce you would eat out of a stylized can.Another favorite presentation was when we received a carton of eggs opened up, with dry ice billowing a fog below it. The egg was deposited by our waiter onto the top of a delicious soup. All I've said so far is amazing so why 3 stars? Indeed it's not in the piece by piece breakdown but in the comparison to other cream of the crop restaurants that brings it down.- I think back to Alinea where I ate a fruit leather balloon or had a decadently filled Chocolate urn shattered onto my waterproof tablecloth. Those were wow moments, I never even imagined food could be served like this, Jaan did not offer surprises of this level. - Dinner prices are the equivalent of an intercontinental flight. A meal at this price is one you don't just hope to remember, you need to remember it. One way of facilitating this is through a printout you can take of the menu. I've gotten these each time, even embossed with my name on them. It's not that I'm going to frame the thing but it can certainly help me remember the experience fondly.- When the cheese tray rolled around as one of the last items I thought to myself well I'm pretty full already but heck this is probably some grade A amazing cheese and I've already paid for it. I was half right; although we had some smelly flavorful cheeses elegantly served they were not included in our chef's tasting menu. I'm a bit upset that I was served cheese costing 140 without anyone bothering to inform me it was not included; I had that expectation from other fine dining restaurants that had included it. I would have certainly denied it to fill up on more of what was to come if I had known. All in all the food was great in taste but presentation that was not up to par with other uber restaurants and not being told about the extra costs set this experience back for me."

Way too complex compilation and presentation. We had 7 course dinner which was actually ten or eleven. It was just too much; it's difficult to explain. For an example, one dish had many ingredients in the bowl. It was served with an egg heated to 55 degrees for 60 minutes, and was pointed out this was an exact process. They then poured the soft egg onto other contents in bowl and stir. Guess what?  It tasted like a bowl of yolk. Which is fine but what's the point of all the other ingredients?  All were like this. The foie gras was best I ever had but all the other stuff took away from it. The pidgin Brest was the only thing I really enjoyed, cooked to perfection. It was only thing I could eat alone although it to was served with a bunch of other distracting stuff I just ignored. All in all, the complexity was a gastronomic distraction and I felt I was eating various states of stews and goulashes. A great chef should be able to produce spectacular dishes without so much variation in one serving. One dish had perfect piece of fish, served with bits of fried squid, topped with caviar, and then a bunch of odd greens and sprouts. Served as a meal with appropriate portions it could have complemented one another but to eat all that in a single bite you got none of the pleasantness of the ingredients and were just left with a mouthful of fishy mush. Well, just one persons thoughts.   ."

""Chye poh"" which actually refers specifically to one of the main ingredients of this condiment, preserved diced Chinese radish.  Although technically a condiment, the ""chye poh"" is in my humble opinion, the star.  Chwee Kueh lives or dies on the quality of the ""chye poh"".  Jian Bo's version is outstanding!  The diced preserved radish is stir-fried with sesame seeds and I suspect in sesame oil.  This elevates the two-dimensional saltiness of the pickled vegetable, giving it all kinds of interesting new flavor profiles with nutty, toasty and buttery notes.  Absolute genius.  I'm not the only one who thinks so, customers typically request extra servings of the condiment. The fine folks at Jian Bo are more than happy to accommodate cravings for their famous condiment.  At $3 for a small container, you'd be hurting from the gouging if this wasn't just simply phenomenal!  I usually just pony up because the ""chye poh"" will also elevate another quotidian standard, ""chye poh neng"" or ""chye poh"" omelette, although frittata is more technically appropriate.  The ""chili"" or ""hot sauce"" is the spice that wakes up the palate.  This is also good, but a certainly less famous member of the entourage, just like Johnny Drama, full of wannabe angst, with anger management issues. It's dried chilies stir-fried with dried shrimps...what's not to like??  The ratios of condiments with each cake are hotly debated and a matter of personal preference and orientation.  At the end of the day, you find what you like, make your peace and keep your mouth shut about whether you think this is better than your cousin's mix.  It's not as contentious as Jameson versus Bushmills, but it's pretty close.At the end of the day, it's all about visiting a Singapore landmark, Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre, ordering up 10 of these lovely creamy rice cakes for less than $4 (at the time of this writing), and enjoying each cake doused with a heaping helping of the aforementioned ""condiments"" and letting the lied of legacy flavors play soothingly in your head.  And may I make so bold as to suggest an intermission of a sip of local milk tea and then letting that music continue to play to an audience of one.Of course, there's also Hai San and Tiong Bahru Fried Kway Teow in the house, so remember to leave enough room for a whole orchestra of flavors to flood your head."

This stall has been around for a long time, I remember visting this stall at the old tiong bahru market when I was a child. It was already very popular since then! The dish is basically rice cakes served with Chai po (turnip meticulously chopped, prepared and fried), and eaten with chilli on the side. It's served on a brown paper (very old school).

As seedy as it may be, with Thai and Vietnamese call girls loitering on the corridors, once you step into the individual restaurants, you'd think that you're in Japan. That's exactly my thoughts after stepping into the super discreet (no sign board) and high security (you need to buzz the intercom before you're allowed in) Kappo Shunsui.Those familiar to the Tokyo food scene may have heard of Shunsui, which was named in Michelin Guide's Bib Gourmand list for three consecutive years between 2015 and 2017. And now, the man behind the same restaurant, Chef Tomo Watanabe, has set up shop here in Singapore.Kappo Shunsui serves a Kappo-style cuisine which is all about creating balance throughout the course  of a meal by the use of five primary cooking techniques: grilling, steaming, frying, simmering and raw preparation. From behind the counter, Chef Watanabe prepares and cooks for the lucky 19 who get a taste of the ever changing seasonal menu made with produce delivered from Tsukiji Market thrice weekly and other imported Japanese ingredients.A qualified kikisake-shi (sake sommelier), Chef Watanabe has also curated an impressive list of close to 100 labels of sake, including bottles not listed on the menu, from his private collection. These are available by the glass and bottle (From $12/63 respectively). Sake pairing for the omakase is also available ($55/85 for 6 glasses of 60ml).I quite enjoyed this very special malty sake with some shoyu scent to it. Aside from sake, other wines and spirits like whisky, shochu and champagne are also available. Omakase is served for dinner, and a la carte options are only available from 9pm onwards. For this season, we had the Zuwai Crab and Uni with Tosazu Jelly to start. The light sweetness of the produce, including the lovely Shizuoka Amela tomato, is complemented by the equally refreshing dashi jelly made with Chef's own dashi stock.The Hamaguri Shinjo warm soup features a clean and elegant dashi with a cloud like fish cake and Chiba clams. The briny savoriness and sweetness of the shell fish, as well as the smoky bonito and dried tuna, conjured the flavors of the sea in our mouths. Lovely.We quickly moved on to the sashimi course of Toro, Botan Ebi, Aori Ika. Just look at that clear red in tuna belly!I was blown away by the glorious Maguro Zuke, which has been soy marinated before being served. Pops of umami, with perfectly cooked and flavored rice. Just bring me all the sushi already!I noted the edo-mae style of preserving fish at Kappo Shunsui. Here's chef with his kelp grouper from Nagasaki, which has been cured in house for about 2 weeks.The firm fish went into the Kue Nabe, a simple but delicious pot of fish with lettuce, leek, and spring onion. Pick up the ingredients and give them a wash in the ponzu and grated radish mix before taking a bite. We sure could eat this all night. A clean sake to go with the nabe! How about an Oita Chawanmushi with Hokkaido uni and Italian truffle caviar? I was a little let down by the ammonia taste of the uni, as i was expecting pure sweetness. Hmm..A grated pear puree with some young yuzu skin to cleanse our palate for the mains.The A4 Omi Gyu Sirloin Roast Beef from Shiga is another highlight of the meal! The beef is marinated in dashi, roasted, and then slow cooked for that lovely tenderness. This is paired with some grilled turnip and a sweet spring fresh onion puree. How about just serving me a slab of this? The final course is always rice and Chef serves his signature claypot rice (which remains constant on his seasonal menu). On his current Spring menu is Red Snapper Claypot Rice served with Red Miso and Shijimi Clam Soup. To make this dish, the rice is first cooked in a clay pot with dashi before Chef Watanabe grills the red snapper over binchotan (white charcoal) until it is 80 percent cooked. The fish is then laid on top of the cooked rice to finish cooking in its gentle residual heat. Chef Watanabe uses a special blend of koshihikari and sasanishiki rice, which provides a lovely, mild stickiness and just the right firmness in the grains. The dashi gives the rice a lovely smoky bonito flavor and i especially love the light spice from the pickled ginger. Sweet (and salty) endings with Azuki Monaka and Warabi Mochi! I love the hint of salt in the red bean paste and how impossibly fluid the mochi was. The mochi is made from the Kyoto Hon Warabi Powder without any other additives. I've never had such a good one in Singapore honestly."

Back in the 80s, my mum went regularly to the old Tiong Bahru Market to buy our weekly groceries. And whenever I accompanied her, I would definitely buy this for lunch.Tiong Bahru market today is a large modern complex completed in May 2006. It has a wet market and shops on the ground floor and the well-ventilated, high ceiling food centre on the second floor. A convenient open-roof carpark sits on the third floor. It replaced the old market which was the first modern market built in a housing area in Singapore. Back then it was also known as Seng Poh Market.Anyway, I disgress. I am glad the standard of my favourite pig's organ soup is still very high. Unlike the typical super peppery or super salty soup found elsewhere, Koh Brother strikes a perfect balance. Just the right amount of pepper, salted veggies that are crunchy and not too salty. Most important, the soup is clear and sweet while the ingredients are super fresh and clean. They also serve glutinous rice intestines which is hard to find these days. All of which, accompanied with their chilli and sweet black sauce, is heavenly."

There was only one ""Amuse Bouche"" item (a puff filled with fermented shrimp) which I wasn't a big fan of. The rest was great - especially enjoyed a crab dish which included crab ice spicy cream. There is a Prix Fixe Menu so no choices other than they will upsell you on Wagyu Beef instead of the regular beef and a better shrimp for one of the seafood dishes... I found the upsale thing a bit awkward as they actually come to your table with a slab of Wagyu and some big shrimp and try to convince you to pay the extra amount to improve your dinner... strange approach for a Michelin Starred Fixed Price Menu.The issue I had with the restaurant was mainly the service. We waited a bit before finally asking if we could order a cocktail - our waiter seemed confused about our order (a gin martini and an old fashioned...not very difficult). It was our last night in Singapore and we were looking to get the whole experience starting with drinks...getting some wine with dinner etc. Before our drinks came we were served the Amuse Bouche course...then quickly after that our first course came out....I then asked the waiter if our drinks would be coming out soon...since usually we would have preferred them BEFORE dinner...again the waiter looked confused then asked us again what drinks we had ordered, a little later he returned and said 5 more minutes. By the time we received our drinks the third course was arriving and of course we never got a chance to order wine...Our waiter was friendly but the elaborate explanations of the food was lost on his poor pronunciations. We didn't understand anything he was saying....which was unfortunate as the dishes were remarkably intricate.  After dinner we were not offered coffee or tea...I guess for the money I would never return or recommend to anyone but it's a shame because the food was really interesting."

The savoury radish cake had a crispy edge and was very fragrant, it looked just like a toasty marshmallow. The next Amuse Bouche that we had was the most beautiful keropok / prawn crackers that was injected with squid ink. This keropok was topped with mayo chili and beautiful orange fish roe and edible flower petal. BAK CHOR MEEBak Chor Mee is a popular local dishes and I usually love the distinct flavour of the chili and sourness that comes from vinegar. The Neo-Sin's version was noodle created from the squid skin served together with anchovies in the shape of minced meat and Hokkaido Scallop that looks like a fish cake. It was a miniature version of Bak Chor Mee that you could find in the local street market. You need to mix everything together to get the best flavour. This cute looking Bak Chor Mee was served on a small bowl with rooster on it, a popular bowl that brought out nostalgic feelings of eating street food during my childhood period.HAINANESE CURRY RICEThe miniature forest with bird ness and quail egg looked very magical when the staff served it in front of me. The green moss looked very delicate and who could guess that it was made from coriander. The white clay that covered the potato was imported from Spain, the 'black rock' minced chicken was very delicious and everything was put on the bed of quinoa curry. Again, it's very important to mix in all the elements to gain the true flavour. This was simply my favourite dish of the night, in terms of look as well as the strong spicy flavour that it gave. SINGAPORE CHILI CRABThis was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it. The chili ice cream was delicious, even when eaten by itself! It was moreover really delicious when mixed together with the soft shell crab. Presentation of each dish really mattered and it showed from the choice of plates that the restaurant used. This dish was presented on a light blue plate that resembled the sea, covered with mantou sand, some caviar, seaweed and foamy crab bisque.SATAY BEEFHubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the '80g' next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big. The Wagyu Ribeye was cooked medium rare, served with gnocchi (onion), satay espuma and rice cakes. The rice cakes in this case was peanut mocha which was skilfully wrapped in banana leaves. The beef was perfectly cooked and with the exact amount of layered fat to make it so enjoyable.XO FISHThe fish of the day was red garoupa with a hidden lobster claw served in the Teochew broth. This dish really reminded me of seafood gumbo although not as thick and heavy. The broth was quite light, filled with seafood flavour and mushroom. I found it best when I mixed the broth with the cooked tomato that was provided so it gave the tangy fresh flavour onto the mix.NEW ITEM: MINI APPLE TOFFEEChef Han came out from his kitchen and said hi to us. Not only that, he also brought out a surprising new item that will only be released in early April. It deceivingly looked like a mini apple toffee.PINAPPLE SORBETOur palate cleanser was a refreshing house-made pinapple sorbet and I joked to the staff that one spoon wasn't enough to clean our palate (hahaha). CHENDOL Xiao Long Bao (XLB)I want more of the Chendol XLB, it was a good start to dessert and the staff was so nice that she helped me take a pour shot by pouring the gula melaka slowly on top of the XLB. For a small item, it was quite rich since it has all the elements of chendol such as red bean, shaved ice and jellies.REESE'S CHOCOLATEThe staff playfully asked whether we smoke or drink before he carried out two ashtray filled with a cigar on each. On the other hand, he gave us a glass of Cognac. It was a peanut butter covered with dark chocolate and the Cognac was the refreshing Earl Grey tea.Now the question on people's mind will usually be 'is it worth the money that I paid for'. For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish.I had a very enjoyable night at Restaurant Labyrinth and so excited that they will add some new menu items soon. I went to the kitchen to thank Chef Han for his delicious food and to tell him that he needs to do a pop up dining in Perth... or I should just visit Singapore again."

I was impressed by the simplicity of the dishes and the amazing flavors that were achieved by combining different ingredients together. I never imaged that a sweet oyster sauce could go so well with fillet steak. My mind was blown!Chef Han's attention to detail and knowledge of the ingredients he uses in his dishes is unmatched. The combination of flavors and tastes create a unique experience that is authentically Singaporean, rather than a so-called fusion of other cuisines. I'm am excited to follow Chef Han as he takes on his next challenge of sourcing his ingredients locally and re-creating an authentic Singaporean fine dining experience, like no other Singaporean chef has done in the past."

I'm by no means an expert on Indian food, but I'm sure what I had was much closer to proper Indian food than what I've had in other countries.

I wasn't sure so played it safe with a '2' (10 is the hottest) and by god a 2 was hot enough for me!! Be warned!It was tasty though, and not so hot the flavour was lost. We shared a couple of naan and some rice between us and overall it was pretty good food, not the biggest portions mind you but that was fine given the heat of the food and the temperature outside.Not the cheapest place, but the service helps soften the blow of the bill.

Over priced menu items for the amount of food you get! Never ever have I paid $ 15-20 for 2-3 pieces of meat in a small bowl of curry3. Mediocre food: chicken curry was the only decent dish - the spice level was inconsistent throughout each dish we got. We got level 4, but the prawn masala was more like 7-8 and was inedible quite frankly 4. Water is a self serviced item- funny enough you have to fetch water from the ""pantry"" which is also marked as a washroom. This was really odd to all of us. 5. The hostess or the owner kept trying to sell us more pappadoms for $15 - with 3 chutneys. I have never paid this much money for any pappadoms! 6.

Also, the menu is witty. However, this restaurant is such a tourist trap and should totally be skipped! This restaurant engages in two distinct practices that triggered tourist trap warning bells in my head from the moment I sat down (a sensation that I found negatively detracted from my dining experience):1. There is definite baiting to get you to spend on add-ons. First, the waiter refused to give us the menu until we placed a drink order. Second, the poppadom that is put on your table is an extra charge. Sketchy sketchy! 2. It is really really challenging to figure out how much your meal will be based on reading the menus. The curries themselves are small portions but priced between $15-$20. This would be fine except that drinks, rice, naan, and whatever else you want are all additional add on! By the time you order all of your sides, you've tacked on an additional $5-$10. But wait, there is more! In order to calculate your full bill, be sure to include the $1.50 poppadom and 10% service charge....honestly, it's enough to make your head dizzy. As for the food/experience, there are so many more authentic Indian restaurants in the area that will charge you more reasonable prices (I have never even paid HALF of what I paid at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining). If you are too picky to try some of the more authentic local offerings and are blessed with a blind eye towards price, then this is certainly a place for you to go ""test your spice tolerance!!!"". However, if you just care about having an authentic experiences in Singapore, do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant!I am really disappointed that such publications as The Washington Post and Lonely Planet so highly recommend this location. My meal at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining was certainly one of those experiences that reminded me to always read travel guides with a critical eye."

I also can't name all of what we were eating as they were just rather spicy, spice-y things that tasted decent (but how could it not, with that many aromatics) but a spicy chickpea curry had tender legumes and the raita was cool and delicious.I don't remember anything fantastic about the chicken tikka - and I think it pretty pricey, so I would stick to the curries. get some naan to go with too, as they were delicious (and so was my roti).in any case, the food was decent.

Mediocre taste. Poor inattentive service. Inflated and overpriced, even by Singapore standards. What more can I say about this terrible place? I was taken there by a friend. The portions were so small that they were able to place all five dishes (of mostly vegetables and just one meat) we ordered onto a gimmicky single round plate no larger than a single serving plate you use in buffets (meant to be shared among four people mind you). Even though the dishes had to be shared, the owner and waitress did not offer serving spoons to us. The taste was extremely mediocre. I've had much better Indian food in the US (Midwest) and Australia (Perth). They didn't even have fragrant basmati rice. Their rice tasted like overnight bad bran. I spent the same amount at two proper Indian restaurants in the same area where I had great tasting dishes of fish, chicken, and seafood (at those other restaurants, not here). It was one of the worst meals I have ever had in Singapore. When I was there, I wondered how the place even survives in Singapore and then I took a look around and knew why. Most of the diners were westerners, which is the only reason this rip-off place has repeat customers, because the only way such a place can maintain a following is by hoodwinking people who are new in town and who fall prey for mindless gimmicks like ""dining-barefoot"" easily. You can also tell from the reviewers in this website that most of the diners (and people who view the place favorably) are westerners who had just moved in to town and obviously are primed for being ""chopped"". This place would close down in a week in the US. Many restaurants in Singapore get away with serving average food and charging a high price in spite of it, because of the high density of Singapore. There are always more unsuspecting or willing diners who need to eat out, no matter how lousy you are. So restaurants just need to be very average. That's why the food standard here is relatively low. But most people here wouldn't understand it until they have lived abroad."

They are all about chilies and spices where you can choose the level of spice that you would like to consume over there. There are up to 10 levels of spice and the highest level anyone has ever achieved is 9. You have to progress your way up the spice ladder whereby you can start at level 6 and only once that is complete, can you go up to level 7 and so forth. These challenges can only take place on a full moon. You even have to put a little clip on the wall and write your name after you successfully complete a spice challenge.

It is also ideal for couples.The yoghurt rice was fragrant and had a wonderful texture to it. It really whetted my appetite and was perfect  for eating curries with. The chicken biryani, likewise, was an instant favourite amongst us, brimming with amazing flavours from the numerous spices used. I found the prices a bit steep here, but for a treat every once in a while, it's definitely worth your money to come to Lagnaa."

Then, they had a seafood cheese fondue thing - which was pretty cool. And their breads were nice and yummmy. The upstairs part is barefoot dining and it is pretty cosy and has a good feel to it. It's a good spot to have a different kind of dining experience.What I Didn't Love: Their prices were wayyy wayy wayyy wayyy wayy off. Thought it was wayyy too steep for me. It came up to $100 just for 2 people? And when I asked them, they said the fondue is pretty much the reason. It's just melted cheese! And the service was kinda slow."

It could very well be that the enjoyment of eating it was in large part due to the hunger accumulated  through the wait, but I'd like to ultimately think that it's all about the food.I've had some pretty good char kway teows in my time and this is definitely up there. If you can get past the fact that you might expect to wait for a good half an hour, it is everything you'd expect it to be. There is that sense that they have done this so often, and so well, that they almost can't do this in any other, nor could they ever do a bad plate. The man at the frying pan is all well kit up, complete with special glasses to prevent oil from splashing at him etc so you know he means business. My favourite parts of their char kway teow are the very distinct bits of egg you'll find unevenly lacing each bit spoonful of it. One confusing thing about this stall is their difference in pricing - they sell plates going at $3/4/5/8/10, and I haven't tried a wide enough range to know the difference.The plate I got today was for $5 and I have a inkling that the $5/8/10 versions come with prawns, which I werent a fan of because they weren't very well cooked, it's always a hassle peeling them and they don't contribute to the taste of the char kway teow at all.I also noticed that when you order more than one plates, while waiting to serve the next plate the lady serving you would cover your first plate with another plate, so the heat is kept in, a sight that while understated, tells me how meticulous they are in providing good service and good food, and that they care about how it tastes to us, even after the money has been passed."

My colleagues thought it was too spicy for them but I thought it was alright. The variety here is drier but the flavours are well-balanced. Pretty generous amount of cockles mixed into it too. I thought it was lacking in the wok hei flavour I will like at a hawker centre but it is a pretty decent plate to have.Apparently, you can request to have your fried kway teow done with lard.

One of my recent favorites is the fried you tiao with enoki mushrooms stuffed in it. Yums!Dessert is also lovely. The mango pomelo sago dessert is very yummy. Perfect for a hot summer day with just the right amount of sweetness and freshness provided by the fruits and pulp.Although situated on the third floor of an old building, you don't feel that it's the case once you step inside. Nice ambience with beautifully renovated interior and a view to the greeneries outside with the glass windows. Agree with the other reviews that the wait staff definitely tries to upsell you.

It was with these same fond memories that we ate at Lei Garden again after many years of not visiting the restaurant, but either I'd grown up or the place has changed quite a bit since I'd last been.For one, the quality of the dim sum was not as I'd remembered it. My favourite dim sum is har gow and I would also eat as much of it as I could, but the har gow skin seemed to have become thicker than I remembered which made it far less enjoyable.

Fine bone china, multiple chopsticks (you know a Chinese restaurant is fancy when they give you more than one pair of chopsticks), cream-coloured walls and seats, thick linen napkins, and high-quality tea.For starters, we had some crispy roasted pork, cut into cubes and dipped into mustard sauce. I have never really understood the appeal of crispy roasted pork, but it's a Canton thing so I suppose Cantonese people like it. For me, I could only admire the fact that the pork was cut into perfect cubes without crumbling the crispy skin. Now how did they manage to do that? This puzzled me for a good part of the evening.A glistening roast duck suddenly appeared next to our table and disappeared just as quickly. They cut the skin into thin squares and wrapped them in a flour wrapper before serving to our table. The duck skin was roasted to crisp perfection but unfortunately tasteless. I slathered on generous amounts of tian mian jiang (Peking duck sauce) and just enjoyed the textures in my mouth - crispy skin, fresh cucumber, and soft flour wrapper.The most savoury dish was probably the twice-cooked pork belly, using pork bell with nice thick layers of fat. This is a traditional Chinese dish called dong bo rou) from Hangzhou, which is close to my home province of Jiangsu. This is usually one of my favourite dishes, but at Lei Gardens, the taste was not at all authentic.The latter half of the meal was filled with rather ordinary and uncomplicated dishes: stewed cabbage with mushrooms, stir-fried asparagus, fried rice, and fried noodles. Simple but well executed.By Singapore standards, this was decent Chinese food, but for this price, I would rather take my money elsewhere."

During my week-long trip to Singapore in January, I managed to secure a lunch reservation at their establishment.Les Amis offers several dining options with seasonally crafted menus which ranges from 65$+ to $295+. We opted for 'Le Menu Tasting' which showcases 6 dishes for $155 per person. It's comprised of one cold appetizer, two hot appetizers, two main courses and one dessert.Dining at Les Amis was a lovely experience. Their angel hair pasta signature dish was to die for. The whole team takes a lot of pride in their work and I commend them for it.

A special note, they have FOUR kinds of butter and 3 kinds of bread: Baguette, sourdough and focaccia.  The mini baguettes were incredible. The butters are smoked (delicious), seaweed (salty), spicy and salted. I tried each and they were all good in their own way, perhaps the best butters I've ever had. Service was great, they explained each item since I didn't remember what any of the courses were. The wine list is as thick as a dictionary but they have affordable wines and wines by the glass.

Consider Lewin Terrace, a Japanese-French fusion restaurant housed in a gorgeous black & white bungalow and nestled amidst the lush greenery of Fort Canning. Take it from the experts, my dining party of bridal publication writers said that Lewin Terrace serves the best food in their category (boutique wedding restaurants i reckon). I definitely agree with the made-in-heaven marriage between Japanese and French cuisine, which was made better by Executive Chef Keisuke Matsumoto and his team of chefs. Lewin Terrace's signature set dinner and seasonal lunch menus change every three months due to its produce-driven philosophy. Here's a look at what we had for their special World Gourmet Summit 2017 menu, along with some wine-sake pairing from their extensive and exclusive wine list. We were lucky to try the dishes prepared by Chef Keisuke Matsumoto and critically-acclaimed pastry chef Kiriko Nakamura from Tirpse for this collaboration.Wagyu Mont Blanc by Matsumoto. The delicate Kagoshima tartar is flavored with capers, oregano and topped with a garlic crust and sweet black garlic puree. The mont blanc is made with lily root puree, which is flavored with truffle. More from the man, the Sendai-style Bouillabaisse. A firm rock fish is used in this dish and we enjoyed the intense seafood flavor from the little mussels. The dish is a lot lighter than the usual in terms of mouthfeel but it's certainly not lacking in the flavor department. My fear of pigeons were somewhat squashed with Matsumoto's version (because #coffeelove). The roasted pigeon is prepared with cacao, coffee and chocolate, and the any possible gaminess was covered by the ginger-red wine-coffee jus. This reminds me of a home-cooked dish of stir-fried liver with ginger.For some luxe comfort food, the Hayashi rice with beef and onion with demi-glaze. This is perfect with the Madena.Then we had 3 desserts by Chef Kiriko Nakamura from Tirpse (1 Michelin star). While it's still sakura season, have some pretty pink Sakura sake which has the scent of strawberries. This pale pink drink is like a moscato with a lighter hint of honey. This goes perfect with Kiriko's next plate of spring, an interesting mix of snap pea sponge with Chitose strawberry and sakura ice cream. The pea sponge may be a little weird on its own but it breaks the sweetness of the strawberries and Sakura."

To my surprise, he looked up to wave when it was my turn to order at the counter. I would soon learn that this display of warmth, which was unexpected given his level of fame these past years, was also somehow transferred to his food creations. Some say the difference between a good dish and an exemplary dish is that the latter is cooked with love. As I placed the first spoonful of rice and chicken into my mouth, I understood this sentiment. Every bite of chicken was tender, and every morsel of rice fragrant.

The key to this place is to get here early, as I showed up 45 min before it even opened and there was already 15 people in line. The food is good and well worth the visit, I ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish. The prices are reasonable so I would suggest stocking up on two plates and sampling something else on the menu.

I had the chicken and rice plate. The food is very simple, with straight-laced Chinese flavors.

That being said, this is the best soysauce chicken I've ever had in my lifetime thus far. Ever since I left singapore I've been craving it so much. It left such a strong impression on me that I now refuse to order soysauce chicken back home because I know I'll be disappointed. The chicken is so so so so tender!!! I ate the white meat, yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist!!! The one place I don't mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark! That says a lot for me. Also the soya is sweet and savory. They pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle. I do wish they gave a little more chicken though. After my first visit, I had to go back and get half a chicken. I also got a side order of the roasted pork and the Cha siu. Each time I've ordered these, they were always very flavorful and juicy. The pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious.Now I'm salivating and hungry and craving all this as I finish my review.

However unexpectedly, it was closed (on a Tuesday). So I'm left with no choice but to try this ""branch"" with a lower rating of mere Bib Gourmand. The experience was nothing short of a MAJOR disappointment. My original intention was to simply write: - Save as to the truly tenderness of chicken, nothing is special. - The chicken is flavour-less. - The soy sauce put on top of the rice does not make it taste different, just normal soy sauce. - Chilli sauce provided is a little weird in taste. - Add-on Roasted Pork is dry, although the skin is indeed crispy. - Food servers at the food collection counter has a TERRIBLE attitude problem, they cannot be bothered to wait for a mere 10-15 seconds of walking time from table seated to the counter but will simply spam and abuses the bell. Extremely rude in manners, simply ""swing"" the tray to your direction, instead of placing it still for your collection. I will not revisit this shop. However, I might still try Hawker Chan's chicken rice at the original shop in the food complex. Let's hope by the real man doing the dishes himself, all these Quality Control defects can be eliminated and I get to enjoy a truly amazing plate of chicken rice. Note:- Always try to visit the stall at second floor Chinatown Food Complex and only take this shop as a backup plan. - The stall opens at 10.00 a.m., multiple reviews suggests that you can avoid the queue by being there at 9.45 a.m. The same reviews suggest that their chicken might be sold out as early as 1 p.m. - According to Michelin's website, they are closed on Wednesdays.- If you're coming straight from Changi Airport, apparently the faster way of getting to this shop was to disembark at Outram Park MRT Station (East West Line) rather than Chinatown MRT Station. Visited 10 October 2017. Food ordered: Soya Sauce Chicken Rice (SGD 3.80), add-on Roasted Pork (SGD 3.00) - Major disappointment. Ordinary chicken rice."

To be fair, this could be my fault. I ordered the 3 BBQ Combo item. This included BBQ pork, Roasted Pork Belly and BBQ Ribs. Maybe I don't quite understand what Michelin means, especially for a ""hawker"". It's only after I sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their Soy Sauce Chicken. I thought Michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole, not just one dish, but I could be wrong. Maybe the Soy Sauce Chicken is worth a try. However, I can say for an absolute fact that the 3 BBQ Combo I got was just pure trash. BBQ pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce. Roasted Pork Belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat. On top of that the Skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily, crisp crunch. Ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce. As someone from the SGV area of SoCal, even he most average Chinese restaurant tops this place.Service (5): The line to order wasn't too bad and moved quickly. For some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier. But there was a order machine right next to them. I skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that. I really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so I am giving it a 5 because of that.Ambiance (3): You will notice I put hawker in quotes on the food section. This is because it's not really a hawker. It's a restaurant. Maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers, but not anymore. It's just a regular restaurant. Nothing special about it. It's pretty bland, but at least it's clean.Price (4): Decent and cheap price. However, this is an American's point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates."

You can find equivalent quality for these other dishes/sides elsewhere.I have tried here twice and enjoy having the noodles with soya sauce chicken. The rice seems quite popular here and so is the Hor Fun except that Hor Fun noodles do not arrive early. My colleague ordered it at 12nn but was told the noodles were not in yet.Waiting in this restaurant is quite comfortable.First you queue up to place an order. As you get nearer the counter, you will eventually have a choice of ordering via a vending machine or continue in the line to the counter staff. People tend to take quite some time at the vending machine so I take that to mean it's not user friendly enough. This ordering queue takes about 15-20 mins, based on the before 12nn crowds.After placing your order and paying up, you will be given a receipt with a queue number. Now you can go to your seat and look out for the TV monitors that show the queue number for food collection.So far, diners there will just eat and go and not much lingering around so you should be able to get a table fairly quickly.I will go back again - just for the chicken."

LOCATION & AMBIENCE 3.5/5Located on level 2 of Marina Bay Sands (MBS), together with a few other fine dining restaurants, Long Chim's entrance can be easily missed. Rather than at the signboard, the entrance is at a colourful stained glass wall about 30m before it. Just before the entrance, one can look down to the entire MBS casino floor with the smell of tobacco smoke wafting up. Whether it helps to whet one's appetite is subjective. The restaurant itself is bathed in the warmth of strategically located lighting mimicking inverted glass funnels, giving it an air of sophistication. After passing the bar, you are greeted by a circular dining area fronted by a ""street food cart"". At the back of the restaurant are where the food is prepared, while to the right are another row of cosy dining tables overlooking the MBS ""basin"" & foyer outside. While I was trying to take in the overall ambience, I kept thinking back to trying to figure out if this was a restaurant trying to serve street food or a street food place trying to be a restaurant. FOOD 2/5After the build up from the ambience of the restaurant, the food that was served fell far short of expectations. The steamed plain white rice was dry & clumpy, the vegetarian fried spring rolls ($13) was too salty (even with the accompanied chilli dipping sauce), the grilled long eggplant with steamed egg salad ($24) was very sour (the only thing nice from it was the steamed egg with runny yolk), the green chicken curry ($24) portion was small with just a few chicken pieces & the green curry gravy (or sauce) could have been slightly thicker & stronger taste wise. The Thai iced milk tea ($10) was good & not too sweet. We decided not to proceed to try the desserts for fear of any further disappointment. SERVICE 3.5/5The friendly staff are at hand to attend to your requests. Child seats are available on request, crayons are also provided, together with the kids menu, to be drawn on.VALUE 2.5/5People will go to any place if the food is good, be it a push cart by the street or a restaurant.

Set within the casino atrium and having Chef David Thompson to helm up this fine little (ok not so little) establishment, I do not think it was unreasonable to walk in with the expectations that it could be somewhat close to Nahm. Of course I wasn't expecting a Michelin star standard but.....  Their Pad Thai was too oily, most of the other dishes were average. The only memorable dishes I took away with for the night were their chive cakes (so good) and seaweed soup which kind of shows how mediocre the standard is. If I blindfolded myself, I would guess that their Tom yum soup was from Thai Express maybe (some mid class franchise across south east Asia- somewhat comparable to Panda Express in the States). Their cocktails are acceptable but nothing to scream about. Happy hour menu was Bottled chang and Leo. Asking me to have bottled beers (rather than draft) at a fancy place is just a no-no for me. Service wise was a mix of both. We had good service in the beginning but waited almost an hour for our second round of cocktails and my friend had to ask twice just for a glass of water. I know the concept behind this restaurant is just a fancy version of street food in Thailand. But there is just nothing special about this place. We paid close to S$700 for a group of 9."

Well, for most of the dishes anyway. I will get out of the way the two that I recommend avoiding: the Padthai (I know! How disappointing to have a miss on the most famous of Thai dishes) and the baked duck. The Padthai was too sweet and the noodles were overly al dente. The baked duck was nothing special. Pretty bland duck that you dip in to sauces to add flavor and the sauces are one note hits too. On to the good! The decor is sooo cool, IMO. The tiles are all imported from Thailand. Lends a Super cool vibe to the restaurant. The bathroom is pretty unique too. You'll just have to go check it out for yourself to see what I mean.The pork and rice cake appetiser is a must try! But you have to love spicy food. It's one of those dishes that takes you on a rollercoaster of regret, acceptance, love and repeat. The heat is intense to say the least. The fried tiger shrimp were simply delicious. Cooked to perfection with a mildly sweet and slightly tangy flavor.They sometimes do an in-house durian ice cream that tasted like a durian fluffy sugar/milk cloud. And the banana roti cake is a religious experience. (Side note, the first time I had it there they kind of burned it a little and I hated it. The subsequent times it has been cooked to perfection.)Definitely give them a try if you're at mbs and jonesing for some yummy ( but expensive) Thai food."

Once you get past the Chilli, the taste is phenomenal. It's a roller coaster of death with a pleasant finish (i.e still being alive).

We especially enjoyed our starter which is:Prawn cakesMains of:Grilled fish, vermicelli with baked prawns, mashed prawn curry & green beef curryAccording to my friend, Thompson's food is an old-school version of Thai food that does not appeal to the young, more modern Thai palate.  Old school or not, what his team (Thompson does not cook here) are doing at Long Chim is top-notch, and at these prices (around $10 for entrees and $20 and upwards for shared mains), one could hardly do better.Anyway, I think Long Chim is a great addition to Singapore's restaurant scene.  Thai food in Singapore generally has a bad rep, which I suspect is largely to do with the inability to source the super-fresh produce and other ingredients which make Thai cuisine such a joy.  Long Chim has made a genuinely impressive start and I hope it will set a new bar for Thai cuisine here."

He has a couple of restaurants in Sydney, and Nahm is his Michelin star restaurant in Bangkok. With a resume like that, we were expecting a really impressive evening.Location: On the waterfront area, in the Casino/Mall complex. Great location because you can walk around the park before or after dinner, see the Supertree grove by night, and you'll have a decent view of the Marina Bay during your meal, depending on your table.Decor/ambience: The place has really beautiful design details in the color scheme, tiles, light fixtures, etc. But it feels mass-manufactured and inauthentic. Like a chain restaurant. Oh wait, it basically is a chain restaurant.Drinks: We had a couple of cocktails each. They are low on alcohol and *very* high on sugar. Despite the interesting ingredients, there's no real craftsmanship in these cocktails.Food: We did the set menu, which is just a selection of items from the regular menu. The chef selects items for your table. I was disappointed with the food because the flavors oscillated between bland and blow-out-your-palate spicy. That being said, we had a couple of starters that were nice, and the mango sticky rice dessert was the best I've ever had.Overall, there was absolutely nothing going on here that isn't done better (and significantly cheaper) at a food stall.

That might be what made it for me. The mix of crunchy with flavourful sauce that not too starchy and good noodles that blends with the sauce.

Like fish fritters, it tastes awesome when eaten crispy, especially when it is soaked in starchy lor mee sauce to give it that delightful balance of crunchy soupiness. While the fritters themselves were well fried, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the sharks meat and normal fish, though. Having this exotic dish already also means the stall could scrimp on more traditional accompaniments to lor mee - I couldn't find many pieces of egg, or ngoh hiong in my bowl of noodles, which, if not for the sharks meat, was nothing spectacular.

I do not remember if I had dined here before. I have definitely stayed in this hotel as well as had afternoon high tea here at their lobby lounge eons ago. My memory is getting fuzzy in recent times, I might have eaten in this chinese restaurant but anyhow that would be a long long time ago. So this review is the same like heading to an establishment which I do not know much about, not sure what to expect especially when the restaurant has a current standing of 3.5 stars on yelp. Not a good sign :(Oh well, I did tell myself if the lunch turned out to be bad, I can blame it on my brother, hehe even though I love my little brother very much.So how was the lunch? This restaurant definitely deserves more then a 3.5 stars. I am giving it a 4. The staffs were all very attentive. Service was top notch. The staffs even went and returned with tiny chairs so that some of us could sit comfortably with purses next to our plush chairs. Service would definitely earn this restaurant a  5 stars but how about the food. Let's see..Prawn & mango roll - A+ Definitely my favorite! It's crispy on the outside, prawns and mango were fresh)duck meat spring roll with yam - B+ The combination was rather odd to me. My brother likes it though but since I am the one writing this review, this will be a B+ dishPrawn dumplings - A. A dish no respectable restaurant in Singapore should messed up. Prawns were fresh and dumpling skin thin and soft (what a good dumpling should always be. Minced pork dumplings with scallops - A. Like the prawn dumplings, they were good, as expected. Rice roll with BBQ meat and coriander - A+ This would be my #2 favorite dish. The meat was so tender, the rice roll was so soft. The coriander brought everything together. It cost a little more than other dishes but totally worth it.Honey glazed BBQ pork buns - A. The buns were fluffy, the meat inside was savory. Maybe my expectation is too high, or simply, if any decent Cantonese restaurant cannot produce good bbq pork buns, they should close the restaurant and maybe sell shoes. Why shoes? Errr.. I don't know. Perhaps, shoes just go by sizes and perhaps width too. Ok, my jet lag is still lingering, can't think properly but any smart person will understand what I am trying to say here.Yam Croquette - A. They were good, but not enough to make me want to return and order the same.Chilled Mango Sago with Pomelo - C. Usually a dessert at the end of any meal would made me very happy, just not this one. The dessert had too much sugar in it, not much mango purée. I declared at the table I could make this at home and taste a whole lot better, that would just mean this dessert completely failed. I still could not understand why the dessert turned up to be so disappointing.I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and that was the reason why I took off one star here."

From now till 31 May 2014, Man Fu Yuan is serving some glorious dishes from the good old days, made using good quality ingredients and special and laborious techniques. Now here are some favorites from the Nostalgic Menu. The flavourful Mixed Beef Stew with handmade beef balls ????? ($28 per portion). I love how the meat is tender and savory. The beef balls were succulent and had nice chunks of water chestnut in them. This is the perfect comfort food.Tea-smoked Pork Belly Char Siew ???? ($24 per portion) takes centre stage, featuring pork belly marinated in a combination of Chinese rose wine and barbecue sauce. It's fatty and decadent but hey YOLO. I loved the Hong Kong Style Steamed Pork Belly in Shrimp Paste ???????? ($28 per portion). This is another comfort dish and i can fully identify with the flavors though i've never had this dish before. Salty, stinky and oh damn delicious. Give me another 2 bowls of rice.Pig Trotters with Vinegar ???  ($28 per portion). The meat was well braised in plum vinegar and you can smell the sour perfume from far. The dish is on the oily side though. Ended dinner with some Hashima. It typically comes served in a coconut but Chef wasn't too pleased with the coconut that day.If you find these flavors familiar and are craving for it now, Man Fu Yuan's A Taste of Nostalgia Menu will be available as part of a rotating a la carte menu available daily till 31 May 2014.

It is a perfect place to impress both your business associates as well as your grandparents.Food : We really liked the trio of dim sum, which showcased both traditional handcrafted dim sum and novelty items with a twist. The old school ""hum sui kok"" (deep-fried glutinous rice dumplings filled with meat) were delightful golden parcels that were both chewy and soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. The chilli crab tart removes the hassle of eating the popular crustacean dish by encasing its meat in buttery pastry crust, while the scallop rice roll is presented in a deliciously deconstructed manner.One of Man Fu Yuan's signature dishes is the stewed noodles with lobster, with good reason. Steeped in a flavoursome stock made from lobster, clams, and mussels, the al dente rice noodles are a perfect accompaniment to the juicy chunks of lobster stir-fried with ginger and spring onion. Another favourite would be the deep-fried salted egg yolk buns - the best we have ever tasted! Imagine biting into a deep fried mantou (bread) and having hot salted egg yolk oozing out like lava and filling your mouth. We were at a lost for words.By the time dessert came around, we were stuffed, but we absolutely couldn't resist the tantalizing hue of golden orange calling our names. The cream of Japanese pumpkin topped with coconut ice cream and black glutinous rice was surprisingly light yet velvety, providing a wonderful finish to our meal.Ambience : Great for business lunches with its blend of modern and traditional Peranakan touches.Service : Excellent!"

Yes, it was good for the novelty. I love food trucks and love the vibe here, but for $10, seems like they only cooked the patty and bun.... As a meat lover, this was overall ok. I was very surprised by how half the burger felt warm and the other cold. The patty, when eaten alone, didn't have much taste. The sauce, however, went well with the patty. Texture and color was also not close enough to beef. It had ok chewiness but not what I wanted in a beef patty, not dense enough? Color was very very red as well. Also, the veggies were not cooked so the onions were too raw for me. the veggies made the patty cold too quickly. And the cheese was mild in flavor and kept breaking into small pieces. Melted cheese in a burger please!!!! Day 2:Get the classic! The Asian don't need to bother. The sauce was a dry paste so it didn't really cover the patty. Didn't taste wasabi or siracha mayo. The patty still has a funky aftertaste, definitely did not fool me to think it was meat. The slaw had not much taste, should be pickled for more flavor. The burger was much smaller than the classic. Sorry my dear friends who I've misled to try the Asian. For those who try tomorrow, go for the classic! At least the cold veggies problem is solved. Overall the beyond burger patty had good chewiness but was very dry. You need a good vehicle of melted cheese and lots of flavorful sauce to enhance the experience. Personally, it doesn't satisfy my meat craving, nor was it better than veggie patties I get from Trader Joe's or the classic Indonesian seitan. P.S. the burger shrank from day 1. I can eat 1.5 of them or even 2. Went with my friends for dinner round 2 cos it was just not satisfying. And everyone was so desperate for a drink, why? There's not supposed to be any MSG in the patty!!!  Food truck ends 8pm on 18 Aug. beyond burgers will be going for $25 from Monday at the Mezza9. #futureofprotein #futureoffood #grandhyattsg #mezza9 #plantbasedburger #alternativeprotein #drklingeats #istillprefermeat #mockmeat2.0 #wheredoesyourfoodcomefrom #grandhyattsg #mezza9sg"

For a fairly reasonable price, you can indulge in a 3 course meal at lunch with coffee/tea thrown in at the end!The bread they served was pretty good - possibly a ciabatta, with a roasted capsicum/pepper dip. I had the sashimi salad, market roasted fish, and tart of the day. The sashimi salad was alright - it was a little too salty from the amount of soy sauce they dumped on it but was otherwise very generous with the raw fish. The market roasted fish was beautifully cooked but was extremely tiny! Just one slice of fish (I had snapper when I was there) with a couple of vegetables. I originally intended to just have 2 courses but it was so small, I was forced to order dessert. The day I was at Mezza9, their tart of the day was pear. While the ice cream served with it was dismal (strange vanilla flavor, creamy but eh), the tart was actually pretty good.

I'm usually not a fan of buffets as the food doesn't tend to be the best quality, but this one is different - top-notch food that was constantly refreshed. While vegetarians will have less selection than meat eaters, there is definitely more than ample food for everyone's tastes. The buffets included a raw bar of crab claws, oysters, even caviar. The cheese table was exceptional - high quality cheese with accompaniments like quince or honey fresh from the honeycomb. There was a Japanese section with many types of sushi & sashimi (including vegetarian). There was a Chinese/Malay section with dim sum buns, meat on a stick, and many different seafood stir frys. The roast section had many options including wagyu beef sliders. The roasted vegetable sides were also plentiful. You could have eggs made to order. Plus there was a salad bar.

This is a great place for many types of diners and the restaurant is so large you can easily enjoy a quiet intimate corner for two, a private dining room for a large family, a big round table for a couple of families or any other type of diner.A real drawback, and perhaps it was just for this brunch, but they seem to have squeezed tables into every possible space and even places they shouldn't have, so you were often having to wait to walk through narrow walkways or trying not to bump seated guests while getting around someone getting food. I even saw a table setup at the hostess stand in the front.A big selling point for us was their family friendly atmosphere and they did not disappoint in this area. They have taken one of the above mentioned private dining rooms and turned it into a kids ""camp"" staffed with at least three ""Counselors"" who do a great job interacting with toddlers to teens. This is a free service that allows the adults to relax, talk, enjoy their meals and try many of the different selections. And there are many different types of food to choose from, I've been told that the 9 in their name refers to the nine different kitchens. There is Sushi, Yakitori, general asian, western, seafood, dessert and others I probably missed. Because of their show kitchen concept this isn't a buffet where the food questionably comes out in chafing dishes prepared in the back; this is food being prepared right in front of you and then often being refreshed into the serving dishes as you are taking. The food preparation doesn't get much fresher, especially for a buffet.I think almost everyone should be able to find something to eat, although I didn't see an Indian section or dedicated vegetarian food; and there wasn't a traditional western breakfast items at this brunch, egg station etc...None of us took part in the champagne part of the brunch, but there were bottles popping everywhere and I saw many other drinks, wine, beer and cocktails going by; and they gave us free flow of coffee and soft drinks as well. Often you ask at a buffet for a beer or a soda and you're told it isn't included, it looks like they will serve you any drink you ask for, and your bill will only reflect alcohol or not.Speaking of the bill it is very expensive to dine here, over $135 without alcohol. This wouldn't be a regular weekend activity but for a group with kids this is a great place to get together for a special occasion."

Since September last year, this menu featuring five desserts and a cheese platter, has been introduced and adds on to the existing cakes/pastries at the Mezza9 shop. What's better way to indulge in their DESSERT PLATTER ($32++) that offers a taste of everything after a satisfying Italian dinner at Pete's Place! Does this look like a hot piping Souffle? In fact, this is a frozen Grand Marnier Souffle  that is no less potent than the bottle of liquor itself. Every spoonful oozed plenty of boozy goodness that I constantly reminded myself to handle this with extra care to minimize spillage. Much has been raved about the astoundingly creamy home-made ice cream and this mixed pool is no exception. The smooth, rich Papua New Guinea vanilla bean and Manjaro chocolate ice cream sat in contrast with the eye-poppingly tart Passionfruit sherbet and zesty raspberry sherbet, creating quite an exciting taste experience that would appease gelato and sherbet fans at the same time. There is a bonus that is not as showy as the curvy nut tuile perched at the top--bitter cacao nibs inside the intense chocolate gelato. Mezza 9 Deconstructed Pavlova ($16++ for ala carte) The cloud-like crispy baked meringues were taken down a notch on sweetness with the sourish kick from the sherbet and berries. Dessert flower pots are no longer any novelty but the Flower Pot ($16++ for ala carte) here is probably one of the better ones in town. It is not spammed with mousse or any cheese cake but a superbly executed caramel sea salt ice cream that enrobed the palates with toasty notes of burnt sugar. To be more precise, the caramel flavour was perfect, something that very few can mastered well (most are either overdone or underdone). Besides the flower pot, the Grand Cru Chocolate Mousse ($16++ ala carte) is my another favourite in this platter. After all the bright flavours, this chocolate jar proved to be a pleasantly bitter sanctuary that soothes the taste buds. I emptied the entire shooter of dark chocolate sauce and sank myself in the blissful chocolate bed.  A divine finish for the divine desserts"

Conveniently located in the Hyatt hotel, this restaurant, while elegant in decor, does nothing much to dissuade me from my prejudice against hotel restaurants. I sat at the chef's bar, which certainly has its own unique level of ambiance. However, the service was very inattentive, nothing close to the reception one should receive when paying these kinds of prices for food in Singapore. I'm fully willing to concede that this lack of service was primarily due to me sitting at the chef's bar and being by myself, but that doesn't entice me to ever return. In terms of the food, I had the grilled fish market selection of the day, which was a tuna steak. Nothing to write home about - not bad, but not anywhere close to the best I've had. This is served a la carte style, so I also ordered the Chinese broccoli to accompany. Again, decent but not great. The best part of the meal was the glass of Pinot. Excellent choice there."

Normally, the gauge of a good restaurant is how dedicated they are to the number of items on their menu - the fewer, the more concentrated their efforts are to perfecting them - but prepare to spend a good 10 minutes deciding on what you want - they cover all the meats - steak, whole chickens, all kinds of fish, pork, seafood, on the grill, raw, stewed, steamed, fried, blanched, in all forms, shapes, sizes, Asian, Western, or an amalgamation of all the above! Went for the Irish Organic Salmon, fennel, lemon confit 200g ($38) with a side of sautéed spinach with garlic (+$9), and MAN did it pack a punch! The salmon was cooked perfectly to my liking - just slightly orange on the outside and rare and succelent on the inside, so it wouldn't flake to the touch of a fork, and the spinach was gut-wrenchingly beautifully done - so tasty, that a gourmet Popeye would have his eyes popping out just at the smell of it.The selection of wines were also very seductive - from all regions, the obscure ones, the famous ones, the celebrity ones (that can go above $500 a bottle!), Argentinian, Chilean, imported from Bordeau... if you're looking to please someone who's extremely fickle at menus (and you're not sure if a certain place will be the right fit), Mezza9 has all the right things (giving you all the right reasons!) to come here.

The decor is older, the atmosphere is hotel restaurant and the tables are so close together you find yourself tripping over people both seated and dishing at the serving stations. The food is fresh and cooked pretty much before your very eyes, the various open kitchens provide you with a show of sorts and the children's area is staffed and perfect in allowing parents the ability to enjoy their meal. I started with the raw bar and ate my way through oysters on the half shell and steamed shrimp. I did need a small bath after shelling the shrimp. Sushi was next and, while it was good, it wasn't particularly fresh or imaginative. The ""Western"" beef was rare and delicious while the lamb was cold and filled with fat. The mashed potatoes were excellent along with the green beans. No carrot cake (my absolute favorite) and the pecan tart was okay, but nothing more. I also enjoyed some delicious cheeses. It was a nice experience, but not one I'd sign up for very often. With four more of these ""hotel Sunday brunch"" places in Singapore, I'll need to shop around for a better experience."

Loved the gravy. 4) Roasted Peking Duck ($38 for small): Paper-crisp skin, with nary a trace of fat, swaddled in soft egg rolls and burnished with sweet hoisin and fresh chives. The prawn crackers was a nice touch, I hardly see that served alongside peking duck anymore. 5) Deep Fried Sea Grouper with Sweet & Sour Sauce ($105 at $15/100gm): sparkling fresh, lightly battered and fried to a delectable crisp, served swimming in a pool of sweetly piquant gravy dotted with peppers.6) Mango Pomelo ($8): smooth, creamy and refreshing7) Ingot Flower Tea ($8.80 per glass): kitschily served as a tight coil, which unwinds with the introduction of hot water.

You can also order off the ala carte menu too--we did that today because vegetables are unfortunately not a dim sum food! The char siew pastry and the scallop dumplings were standouts; the goldfish dumpling (stuffed with prawn lah) was super adorable.

And the price is not too steep either! For about $5/pax, you can get a nice steaming pot of clay pot cooked over a legit charcoal oven (most food these days are cooked over gas stove), filled with salted fish, pork sausage and chicken. The plethora of flavors make this a really tasty dish (for halal customers you can also ask for the pork sausage to be removed). Rice is soft, chicken pieces are tender and the salted fish really adds a whole new dimension.Furthermore, you get to decide how much oil and black sauce to add. Usually I would add until about 90% of the rice grains are black (my stirring sucks, sadly), and oil until the grains are shiny enough. Yes, this sounds unhealthy, but once in a while dish, it's worth it!And usually, we would add some soup as a side. I recommend watercress soup.Note that the food centre is like almost entirely closed save for this stall at night, so seats are aplenty.

Then I moved away and made my way back again when I was in university, only because of the proximity. Don't get me wrong, the claypot rice is actually pretty good in my opinion.  The stall still sticks to using charcoal for their cooking and this gives the final dish a nice smoky flavour. One thing I love is the little salted fish bits that they put inside the rice along with the chicken and sausage slices - there are others who think of them as nothing more than little balls of salt but I beg to differ.Part of the fun of going to New Lucky is being able to decide how much sauce goes into your dish. At the start of the meal, you are given two metal cups - one filled with dark sauce, the other with fragrant oil. And, they leave it entirely up to you how much you want to put into your rice. I have had an instance where this went horribly wrong and I ended up having to eat rich swimming in oil thanks to a friend's horrible estimation skills.

I've always heard about how this claypot rice served with chicken was one of the best in Singapore, so I decided to give it a try once. While it is true that they are one of the rare stalls in Singapore still making use of charcoal to cook their rice, I don't find it to be as mind-blowing as some describe it to be. One good point however is how they add small pieces of salted fish to flavour the rice - which is not done by all stalls selling this dish. However the rice itself may or may not be too dry for my taste, and it is this inconsistency that I have a love-hate thing with. But to have it cooked for us true-blue Singaporean style with real charcoal is a great experience. Another plus point is that they serve various home-cooked soups as well. Try getting the lotus soup or black chicken soup to soothe your throat after a heaty meal like claypot rice - especially if you like the burnt rice portions like me!"

Combining with the soup - every spoonful makes it enjoyable and the part I get disappointed is at the very last spoonful - no more left! Eat the mutton with the chilli sauce provided and you know what I mean. This stall has been around for many years and business is still as good as before.Many times I want to ask for another bowl but can't eat too much of it as it's not exactly healthy. Price has gone up but the serving is reasonable. So if you happen to be at Bedok Central, drop by here to enjoy, you won't be disappointed."

While the prices have increased, the quality has remained the same.

In any case, the honor is well-deserved as Nouri was one of the most interesting dining experiences I have had in Singapore.  The food is flavorful, artistic and thought provoking all at the same time. The meal started with simple courses like salmon roe on lettuce and concentrated jellied-broth before moving on to some complex dishes like a wild rice stem served withsteam roasted Makomotake, spiced buttermilk gratin, cultured cabbage.  The risotto with fermented Japanese chilli paste, aged carnaroli rice, and deep water scarlet prawns was extremely flavorful, while the Brazilian fritter was also quite good.  For the main course, we went with the grass-fed wagyu rump cap, which was so tender and very artistically presented with various oils and nasturtium leaves.Service was very solid, a bit off beat and very entertaining.  Our server knew the menu very well as well as made very interesting suggestion for wines.  After the Michelin awards, I expect that Nouri will become been more popular and it will be interesting to see how the menu and concept evolves.  So far, my favorite place in 2018!"

There is no pretentiousness like I'm noticing after the Stars have been awarded like in other restaurants where there once was no such thing (e.q. Corner House).I agree with Nik T that Odette was always in the shadows of the more adventurous and experimental Andre but now that the latter has closed its doors, Odette truly shines above all other Singapore Michelin Stars. The dishes are beautiful and full of flavor as well as many courses with the bells and whistles of dry ice and smoke.The ambiance is comfortable but the staff quickly makes you feel at home, very conversational and full of knowledge and warmth. Although this is a typical long tasting menu dinner, if there was any in Singapore to spend on that is uniquely Singapore, definitely do Odette."

Dinner menus are priced $208 and $268 for 6- or 8-courses respectively.  Note that the 6-course dinner is not available from Friday and Saturday. Vegetarian menus are available too. We took both the normal menus to try. Upon seating, we were asked which type of water we would like, still or sparkling. $9/person free flow seemed reasonable. Tap is available for free though. First up were canapés. 4 bite-sized delights. All quite tasty (sorry can't remember the details). Followed by amuse bouche of mushroom ""tea"". This was good, full of umami though that a half piece of brioche as a chaser was unnecessary in my view. Then the bread platter arrived. A piece of tree bark was used in place of a plate. Presentation was great! 3 different types of bread were served - chia seed focaccia was our favorite, but the sourdough wedge was lovely too. The thyme brioche was the weakest link. The flavor wasn't intense enough to make any impact. Two different butters were served - salted lardo (yes, it's piggy fat) and unsalted butter. Then the meal was served proper. I shan't go into details of each plate but they were all well presented and tasty. But I wouldn't say it's overwhelming impressive, especially if they are aiming for the Michelin star. Service was choppy, my glass of water was empty for a good while before it was noticed and topped up. Most of the servers are foreigners and cannot enunciate their words properly. Dinner ended with petit fours, the lemon meringue lollipop was the most interesting and best of the lot. Canele was a close second though. A good experience overall but I won't be in a hurry to come back. Maybe for the less pricy lunch but not otherwise."

The limited number of tables available and the fairly egalitarian reservation policy is a big factor, though some would say Julien is the biggest pull and who doesn't want to see the insides of the Supreme Court anyway? The wait time for a table on the weekend now stands at about 1.5 months, though cancellations do happen so I recommend calling up the hostess to leave your number. Fine dining restaurants usually have a ""money table"" and another for last minute special people but this doesn't exist at Odette, which I found out after several people came back to me empty handed.So was it worth the wait? I think the restaurant has a lot of potential and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, but I didn't walk away with my mind blown. So the answer is... ""I guess so"". There are clear signs of greatness in the attention to detail in plating picturesque dishes, the variety of flavors and textures and some theatrical sauce-pouring and smoke. The price point is incredible value as well at $128 for 6 creative courses. Plus I love the design of the restaurant - it makes one feel calm, uncluttered and chic. I liked my amuse bouche, pork belly and bread (don't laugh...the restaurants that ace bread-making tend to make great food too) but I was also bored by the play it safe ingredient list: Truffles in every other fish? Check. Pork belly? Check. Foie gras? Check. Given how well the dishes were executed, why not be adventurous with the produce? I've heard the French are as nose-to-tail happy as Chinese to some degree after all. There lies the problem I suppose - I didn't think any dish was bad but I didn't find anything so unique or memorable that I could recall its name or contents a week later. Yes I was with a work-related acquaintance and so my mind wasn't 100% focused on the food, but I tried Per Se in a similar context and could still remember the piece of SRF slow cooked beef I had that melted in my mouth, the famous pearls and the insane ending line-up of desserts. I will end by saying that I'm still tempted to return to try the dinner degustation because the chefs could have been limited by the affordable price point required at lunchtime. In a way, I think the food at Odette is like a straight A student at the PSLE exams - schooled in good techniques and scoring points, but needs to use that to express some real creativity and risk to achieve greatness.  Let's see what happens."

It's totally underrated, and flies so low under the radar, that it was 3 years before I learned of its illustrious lineage: Ola's head chef was the executive chef of the short-lived celebrity restaurant Santi at MBS.Dinner-time will find the restaurant a lot more chilled and tranquil, compared to the frenzied boisterousness of the lunchtime crowd. I much prefer dinners here; there's a languorous ambience perfect for savouring OLA's exquisite tapas. Service is also a lot more intimate and attentive. We had:1) 36-months aged Jamon Iberico '5J' ($48): sublime fatty salty ribbons of cured pork shoulder sided by catalan toasts and fresh tomato puree. Pricey, but sublime nonetheless.2) Burrata with Pesto ($35) with heirloom tomatoes, edamame, and crispy jamon curls: an off-menu special that was a fantastic recommendation by the affable manager. Incredibly balanced in terms of flavour and texture, this is a must-try if ever it's in season.3) Gambas ($25) - of fresh sweet prawns swimming in a medley of roasted garlic oil, dried chilli, and espelette pepper: heady and aromatic. Dish with the complimentary crusty bread, great fodder for the robustly flavoured oil.4) Pulpo ($26): Spanish octopus grilled to a luscious and smoky finish, and complemented by a nutty lentil sauce, and lightly spiced romesco vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of octopus (the tentacles scare me), but even I was blown away by this.5) Conchas a la Parmesana ($35): a duo of plump Hokkaido scallops baked to a succulent caramelization, was set atop parmesan grains, and a creamy lime and brandy aioli. Decent, but not outstanding.6) Fiduea con Secreto Iberico y Setas ($45): loved the flavourful noodle paella dish loaded with organic oyster mushrooms and grilled iberico pork, even if my galfriend found its sweet undertones disconcerting.7) Ceviche ($25): only lackluster dish where the potent taste of the wild seabass overwhelmed the delicate flavours of the lime, chilli, and onion marinade"

Coupled with the rustic, crusty bread they serve? Heavenly.Everything else though? Good but unspectacular. For tapas, we had the grilled octopus, the calamari, and the croquettas. I enjoyed all three, to be fair, but the grilled octopus, while tasty, wasn't quite there in terms of texture, and didn't quite match up to my standard for grilled octopus here in Singapore. The calamari was... interesting, I enjoyed the sauces, it was fresh, well cooked, but not... mind-blowing, if you know I mean. It was good, but not memorable. Croquettas. I love croquettas, and the ones here are definitely worth ordering... but not worth going to the restaurant for. Crisp, creamy, generously sized, personally (and this really is a personal thing) I think it could have used a little bit more potato to offset the creaminess. Some people like creamy though, so don't let me discourage you from trooping down to give it a try.For mains we ordered the seafood stew and the paella. The paella... was average. I preferred BOMBA's, and we didn't even finish it because it wasn't really attention grabbing in terms of flavour or texture. The seafood stew was fresh, and a very generous portion, but the broth was a little thin for it to be a 4 or 5 star dish.The Sangria however, was EXCELLENT. If you're a fan of sangria that's fruity, light, and refreshing, then you'll love Ola's. So... yeah. I'm admittedly a little picky and don't hand out 4 or 5 star ratings that easily, but Ola was a pleasant meal, and they're worth visiting (or even revisiting). But I wouldn't say ""I'm a fan""."

We started the meal with complimentary freshly-baked focaccia, which was warm and fluffy. The waiters were nice enough to inform us that the orders would take a while to arrive since the kitchen was better suited to expedite the set lunches during the weekday lunch slot. Was recommended and ordered the daily special, the uni pasta, which was delicious, if not slightly heavy, but perfect for sharing. Highly recommend this dish if it's available. The truffle tagliolini was tasty as well, creamy with a strong taste of truffle. We also shared the cod and the pork cheek among us. I personally preferred the pork cheek, which was tender, flavorful and beautifully presented. The cod could have been slightly less fishy, but I did enjoy the accompanying veggies. Vey value for money with the Entertainer app ($120), with high quality food and good ambience. Would return!"

It is a elegant Italian restaurant and bar by Beppe De Vito. The restaurant is located just behind One Raffles and just a stone throw from the Raffles Place MRT station. The place is simple in decoration from the main street. One would just take it as another bar place with its high chairs in the alfresco dining area. But inside it is elegant looking which reminds one of the old Hollywood movies with its white table cloths and comfortable leather armchairs.Surprisely this year the restaurant is taking part in the restaurant week event and offers a 4 course dinner set meal at $58++ per person.But what is a meal here without its signature artisanal pastas? Therefore we decided to add an additional order of pasta.Pappardelle with Pork Cheek & Red Wine ($28++)The pasta was the flat and broad type, which had a soft and chewy texture. The pork cheek was in small cubes and tasted quite well braised, which reminded me of the chinese style Tau Yu Bak (Soy Sauce Braised Pork Belly). The fatty pork fat was crispy and melt in the mouth which I could not get enough of it. One serving of this was simply not enough.We started the meal with bread roll, served with vinegar and olive oil dip. The bread was soft and pillowy.For amuse bouche, we were served deep fried balls, filled with molten cheesy filling and topped with shredded cheese.Scallop Carpaccio with Fava Beans, Quail Egg and Raspberry BalsamicoIt was light and simple dish to start the meal with, although I wish that the scallop had been sliced thinner.Crab ravioli with lobster bisque and basil foamThe ravioli was very tender and juicy on its own, but with the lobster bisque the dish became a bit too salty to have.Atlantic cod with sea urchin zabaglione, sunchoke and RomanescoThe creamy rich yellowish sea urchin which tasted of the sea, and the earthly greyish sunchoke gave a dish a unique taste. Interesting to have the dish decorated with Romanesco broccoli (also known as Roman cauliflower or pagoda cauliflower [yes it was sold as pagoda cauliflower in Giant supermarket]). However the strong flavours of the sauces failed to balance with the fish. The fish seem to be a bit too firm in texture.Amalfi lemon & white chocolate lingotto with red berriesLemony flavoured white chocolate mousse with crunchy chocolate pops in it, sitting on top of the chocolate sponge. The sweet and light cake balanced by the slightly sour raspberries. There was also a small patch matcha flavoured sponge in the centre. Interesting different flavours.We ended the meal with coffee and tea, served with sugar coated peanuts.Overall the food was great although I felt that the restaurant week set meal had not showcased the best of what the restaurant can offer. The service offered by the staffs was great. The staffs were knowledgeable, even for the young looking one when we asked him about the ingredients in the dish. Water was refilled often. Bread crumbs left by the crispy bread was cleared smoothly by the staff with a metal stick. The only exception was that the place was quite noisy when the restaurant was packed. Another thing to note was that there was free wifi in the restaurant. It was rare to find such an atas looking offering this service."

I have not heard of her name till last week when I was introduced to this elegant Italian restaurant and bar by Beppe De Vito.It threw me a surprise as I did not expect the environment being upscale and immediately I felt as though I'm in a foreign country with most of their staff being Caucasians. The outer part of the dining place is a Alfresco area installed with ceiling fans and laid with beautiful furnishings and Italian Marble. And since its located in a strategic location among the CBD offices, do check out their exquisite bar lounge right next to its entrance.As you walked deeper into the restaurant,  feel the ambiance while you enjoy a good passion for Italian Cuisine with quality and freshness of ingredients. The 80 Seater Osteria environment lays a comfortable European feel with dining table neatly spread with white table cloth and bright red leather chairs.Let's start off the Italian gastronomic heritage with our Restaurant Week Dinner Menu at $58++ per pax...Besides dipping the warm buns into balsamic vinegar oil, what I like best was these 2 soft sponge starters that contains cheese in them!Plain water for the teetotalers...The overlapping of scallops was topped with fava beans and elegantly decorated with flowers and the halves of Quail Egg. Paring the starter with raspberry balsmico gave a different taste to the plain sweet scallop. If you love sashimi, you will love the texture of this dish!Pappardelle was our additional order on top of the restaurant week menu. These large, board flat pasta noodles were perfectly cooked and was really delicious in its red wine sauce and shredded cheese topping. I enjoyed their softness of pork cheek which literally melts in your mouth. Crispy pork lards / belly meats had not only added another texture to the dish but also gave a good aroma to it.Pappardelle with Pork Cheek & Red Wine - $28The miniature size of ravioli had immediately caught my attention with its green foam and brown lobster bisque that was generously spread on top of the pasta. These Ravioli contained shredded crabs meat in its bag. As a whole, its a dish proportionately spread out and their sauce left my lips wanting for more.Colors of the dish is interestingly match among 3 colours here and ravioli within a size of a table spoon.Here comes the main with a large cube of Atlantic Cod sitting on Sea Urchin Zabaglione with Sunchoke paste underneath and Romanesco Broccoli as sides. Other than the Cod on this main dish, all the rest was my very first try out. Initially, I'm not very use to the taste of Zabaglione and sea urchin but after a few mouthful of it, I got addicted. Though I'm someone who enjoys the freshness of consuming cod fish, the style of its preparation was not to my likingAmazing ending to the meal with a good dessert that kind of act as a palate cleanser to the seafood dish earlier on. A mixture of black, rasp and strawberry fruits on its top layer with some matcha sponge cake while in the second layer it was well done with white chocolate that was not too sweet. What I like about the middle layer was the little crunchy chocolate balls surprises in between the bites. And finally, a good closing up to the meal with our tea and coffee in place accompanied by some sugar coated peanuts.To be frank, it was a great opportunity to have visited Osteria Art. I love how my dining was without any hurry to rush us off even after we completed our meals. Waiters will still continue to top up our glasses of plain water. Praises to their service and not only that, waiter that served us was well trained , knowledgeable and knows the menu well.Bearing the mind of its ambiance and budget, it is best recommended for special occasion."

Menu at $35++ is very good value given the quantity and quality. Starter chosen was the Tuscan chickpea soup with garlic breadcrumbs. Too bad the soup was a little under seasoned. Main chosen was the braised lamb shank with potato mash. I was glad the shank was regular sized and not skimpy just cuz it is lunch. And moreover, meat was tender and flavorful without the gaminess. The mash tasted quite buttery so I didn't finish it up (I don't like the overwhelming butter taste). Dessert was a petit portion of pistachio cake topped with a layer of chocolate ganache and then pistachio mousse. Accompanying is an almond biscuit and some sour berry compote.  I felt these were a little out of place on the dessert plate. Lastly, coffee or tea of your choice. Finished the lunch in 1 hour 15 mins. Decent for a power lunch !"

Ok, the deep fried calamari was good, but it's deep fried, with batter. How can you ruin that?The seafood soup was ok. Marginal. The bowl was huge, and the seafood was...hidden...somewhere.My main was a seabass with spinach and tomato puree. It was ok. Nothing special.And then there was dessert. It was a flavour play on strawberry compote with olive sponge cake. The cake was sweet, so I was confused, and then, the sweet strawberry, made a little more sense. But not by much.Overall, for 2 people, with one cocktail, the bill was $85 per person. Market street, CBD pricing, but nothing special for Italian."

I was excited to finally make it to Pollen. A friend whose palate I trust enormously held it as the best in Singapore a few years ago yet the location made it hard to convince either friends or the other inhabitant of the home to trek there - and locals know Marina Bay Gardens well enough that the location is not that exotic anymore. Unfortunately it seems Atherton has left; fortunately his replacement used to be at the Claridges in London which back when I was there had a solid reputation. The little train from the taxi stand is an amusing start, although had the sun been out in force we may not have enjoyed it as much. The location was indeed very nice, not just the Dome but the indoor decoration, spacious, with enough space between tables to have some privacy, yet open and well lit (as you'd expect in a giant greenhouse). It is REALLY cold inside, but we were forewarned and brought woolly things. Felt just like London really. My first thought with every dish was how British that cooking was. Well sourced ingredients, prepared simply without artifices to hide their flavour, chosen to match each other. This is the Michelin/nouvelle cuisine equivalent of comfort food and to be honest a welcome sight, we're a bit tired of foam and smoke with no taste, the excitement should be on the fork. The tarte tatin is for some reason sold as a portion for two; well, I could have finished it myself, it was very well done. That's why it gets its own paragraph. Of course this, as well as the great bread, would not have been as noticeable in Europe with its plethora of French and French-trained chefs and bakers, but here, it is rare enough to warrant ignoring the banana ice cream and jelly option (whose gula melaka was the only trace of a nod to local tastes I could find). Now some minor criticisms: 55++ for a three course lunch is quite steep, however the location may explain it; the wine options were so boring we ignored the list; the cocktails (whose list is even more limited than before) seem unimaginative and using cheap bases which detract from the restaurant; the old list shown on a 2012 review has Hakushu 12yo, this one either Bacardi or Malibu rum. That would have been an easy 22++ they lost out on. I'd recommend the restaurant manager visit the Auld Alliance and chat with their manager about ideas for interesting stuff without breaking the bank. Finally, the lonely cheese board looked quite miserable with few options, none AOC/fermier, all quite boring, in other words some branches of Cold Storage have more choice and perhaps better quality. I only looked at it twice though, but again, an easy 10++ with a bit of thinking. If the Swissotel Equinox buffet can have free flow raw milk AOC 18 month aged cheese Pollen can afford to up their game. The chocolates at the end were not bad, however the ""fennel"" was absent from its namesake piece. All in all, this is a solid choice to take guests from abroad who will enjoy the surroundings. Not a bad option for a Sunday lunch either. If only they sorted out their booze..."

I can't say anything about the food since they don't serve food between their lunch and dinner service, but they use fresh herbs that grow in the little garden beds surrounding the dining area. I guess that's pretty cool. They do have a large variety of beverages, from wine and beer to coffee and tea. I just wish the service was a little better to match the high price tag."

With High Tea one needs a little more time to nurse the wine, enjoy the aromatic teas and more so enjoy the treats.Here's a tip for Pollen - serve up the savories first individually. Not all at once. Leave the menu on the table so your patrons can review the items they have been served with. With the tray that had everything on board, we weren't really sure which was which. Bottom line - darn good treats for high tea, good service, allow your patrons to be charmed by your treats, but give them time.Yes, I'll come back.This review was for a visit on Apr 25 2017"

It was ok. As an after thought I realise the western restaurants this place attempts to emulate typically provide bread as an appetiser. Not yet normal in Singapore.We ordered the risotto with beef cheeks and the ribeye steak. The plates appear of a conservative size but were filling. The beef was well cooked and if I were to go again I'd order all of it again.The restaurant has daily offers but they are subject to demand and both the desserts of the day were gone by the time it came to us at 7pm.The only thing that was a bit bizarre was the service. We ordered water that didn't come until the third time of asking and plates were cleared before everyone on the table had finished eating.Table water is also expensive at 5sgd per person (possibly by cup- we didn't confirm that).

Ordering is at the cashier, rather weird, for a cafe/restaurant looking of certain calibre. A long line of customers were waiting to get their orders taken. We were really excited about beignets and arancini, but sadly the beignets were not available... (AND not indicated on the menu!!) The arancini came. Small cute cripsy balls, could be more cheesy.. And strangely without any tomato sauce. but ok, the flavor was reasonable. The thing I could not BELIEVE, was that there was a strand of hair EMBEDDED In my arancini. NO.

The plating and presentation will be flawless.  Everything is very beautifully arranged and presented on large oversized white plates or bowls.2. Every morsel will be delicious. (Enough said.)3. The portions will be small.   If you sit down with a ravenous appetite, there's a good chance you'll leave a little hungry. No matter the course, when they serve you that enormous oversized white plate with the small beautiful portion of food in the middle, you'll be met with the bitter sweet realization that it will all be over in just  5 or 6 bites.  We assume that if you order the same dish a la carte that the portion size will be larger.   I am not sure.After the meal, you get complimentary entry into the Flower Dome.  Leaving the lower level restaurant, we took the elevator up to exit through the upstairs cafe.   The elevator doors opened into the cafe and we were met with bright sunlight, loud families, and the hectic atmosphere of a theme park patio dining area. I say this to point out the difference between the fine dining lower level restaurant and the upstairs cafe.  I'm sure the upstairs is also nice, but it's two different experiences.The Good: The atmosphere, food and service.  Complimentary entry into the Flower Dome.The Bad:  Laughably (gourmet sized) small portions.  On our first visit we sat at the table next to the entry into the Flower Dome.  The massive aircon units for the Flower Dome must be nearby.  There was such a cold draft that we were all MISERABLE.  Chilled to the bone. They offer shawls for the ladies.  My recommendation is to bring a sweater.The Verdict:  I highly recommend Pollen for lunch or dinner. It's an especially nice place to bring out of town visitors.   Make a reservation and arrive a little early to take the chauffeured buggy to the restaurant.  Leave yourself some time afterwards to stroll through the Flower Dome."

I got 2 glasses of champagne, a flower tea, and the small bites from 1 order of the high tea menu, all of which was more than adequate for my mother and I. I believe the bill came out to $80.

It also is the second outlet of his London flagship restaurant, Pollen Street Social. The food here is supposed to be Mediterranean-inspired modern European cuisine but really, i don't see or taste the Mediterranean at all.Dinner started with 3 little amuse bouche, all of which distracted us from the important task of creating our menu for the night.Choux bun filled with cheese and truffle. Cracklings served with an apple puree and arancini (breaded rice ball with cheese) served with hummus. Adored the arancini with the creamy risotto style rice.Our starters:The Mosaic of foie gras and confit duck with cherries and tangy apple puree ($40) was quite different from the usual that is served with berries compote. I highly recommend the Trip to Japan 2012 ($38). Stellar succulent and sweet scallop sashimi were served atop marinated daikon in a lemony and saltish broth of sake and mirin. The sea urchin didn't make a difference to the overall dish. Kinda seemed like it was thrown in just to glorify the dish. More snow in this one (horseradish) but it melted when we were happily snapping away. The Scottish lobster ($55) was an elaborate dish. When it was served, we were wondering if we accidentally ordered extra food. This was a 3 course dish and it consisted of an intense lobster bisque, a lobster 'burger' and chilled lobster with fennel cream and sea urchin.Our favorite was the bisque which was served in a wine glass. Exactly the way it should be savored. Next was the burger was done a la atas lobster roll style but with a buttery brioche bun. These were way better than the tasteless rubbery lobster chunks that were served with fennel cream and sea urchin. Again, the sea urchin was purposeless. Our mains- Kurobuta pork belly, braised cheek, charred spring onions, butternut squash, Sudachi lime ($67). There was a great balance of fat and meat. Take away all the sides and you have pork belly done Asian way. This is really good roast pork with kong ba essentially. The caramelized and smokey leek with sweet pumpkin puree were great accompaniments. The overall dish was delightful with the various textures and flavors. Halibut ($70) was recommended by our server. This is a lightly flavored dish and i'm more a fan of strong flavors. Despite that, the simply pan fried fish held up on its own.We were stuffed but we had to have desserts to conclude our Pollen experience. We had the Pollen ""Tatin"" which was made of Verjusm creme fraiche, caramel jelly, red and green apples ($20). I'd much rather a pot of tea with their stellar petit fours. For that i had the moist matcha cake, perfect lime macaron, smooth coffee chocolate and a piece of candy to end the meal. Overall, the Pollen experience was great. Lovely ambience that was comfortable and cosy. Great service as well though they could be a little more attentive. Plus the food was pretty good too. Certainly would recommend Pollen for a special occasion."

I say bouquet because we both treated them as a table decoration.  They went untouched.  They looked quite fresh but neither of us ventured to try them.tinyurl.com/bzhe6g9Receipt (Dinner for two - $597.92)tinyurl.com/aw68s25Overall - This was a very enjoyable dining experience.  The food was consistently well prepared.  While there were brief lapses, the service was professional, friendly, and helpful.  The room is one of my favourite thus far in Singapore.  There is always a fine line and it can be difficult to discern what separates four stars from five.  I truly like Pollen but I thought via a smidgen here and a smidgen there, that it fell just short of five stars.  I would certainly have no issue in returning to or recommending Pollen."

The restaurant is two storeys and its the cafe upstairs that's in a corner of the Flower Dome. After a meal or high tea at Pollen, guests can wander into the rest of the Flower Dome and bypass the admissions charge. This is probably the only good thing I have to say about Pollen. I would liken this place to a F&B rest stop at a tourist attraction. Imagine you're at the local zoo and you're looking to sit down for a bit and enjoy and overpriced snack... that's what Pollen is. I can't believe this is a Jason Atherton restaurant. You should only come here if you've (1) had a long day at Gardens by the Bay, (2) intended to go into the Flower Dome and (3) wanted to have a snack or meal. I recently came here for their $38/person high tea. Our waiter was brusque & inattentive. Everything was completely meh. The scones are dry and came with a smidgen of strawberry jam. Don't scones usually come with clotted cream or butter? I asked the waiter if he had clotted cream or butter. At first he looked shocked, and then he said he could get me butter like it was the first time he heard such an outrageous request. The tea came in a tiny teacup, no teapot in sight or any indication that they kept the teapots at the counter to refill your cup for you. What does it say about the service if the place is less than a quarter full and you need to ask if the tea is refillable because your cup is so small and has sat empty for 15 minutes? Of course I never ever give servers a hard time, I just nicely asked if my tea was refillable (because I would not have been surprised if it wasn't). Definitely won't be back."

If we were closer to the source of the ingredients then i'm sure it will be that smidgen more magical. We had the 8 course menu and everything was tasty, some things weaker than others, but I can't cook like that, so it's not an issue to me.I am still giving it 5 stars despite the fact that the service was polite and blundering at the same time. They gave me extra pork crackling.I've heard bad things from people who have gone for lunch and if your experience of Pollen involves slumming it with the tourists on the upper deck of the restaurant on the frankly, hideous garden furniture, then perhaps there is no chance of redemption. I suspect that restaurants like these make a better effort at dinner time.So, top tip. Go for dinner, take your time, order the set menu, and if you do think its less than perfect, remember you are slap bang on the equator."

The second restuarant in Singapore; Chef Jason Atherton of one Michelin-starred - Pollen Street Social, replicates its collection of modern European fare with a Mediterranean twist for diners to enjoy in a casual way. Some of the dish takes after his London resto; the popular ones are seen injected into the new Mediterranean eatery. I liked how the name integrate with its location, mimics a perfect match in heaven - Pollen @Flower Dome of Gardens By The Bay, some kind of a tailored business opportunity. Or was it a karma or faith to bring together?The 140-seater restaurant comes with 2 decks - the lower floor which is the dining area & dessert bar sits 80 diners while the upper level which serves as a bar area can accommodate another 60 guests exposed to the green foliage. I entered the restaurant via the Flower Dome as I have gotten a pair of tickets to both conservatories. In fact, you needn't buy the Flower Dome conservatory ticket to visit Pollen, just pop in by its ground level entrance which is accessible via the Gardens, free of charge. The best part, you still get to walk the Flower Dome after your meals, absolutely free paying - saving your $10 (Singaporean) - more bang for your buck! The furnishing and decor of the 2 decks were not identical. Very awe-inspiring and I get to enjoy both in a single dining.We started off with Salad of buttered lobster, pasta, seaweed (of which I opted out), maple dressing. A very refreshing salad with unpretentious sweet tangy seasoning, less of a maple flavour. The homemade pasta has an unusual texture of its own - flabby and soft noodles not the regular al dente that one would expect, nonetheless very gratifying. Then comes the sweet & succulent lobster meat, so fresh that you could smell the ocean breeze. Fighting against it, the baby Romanine was crisp to the core, served in total freshness.Scallop carpaccio, cucumber, apple, horseradish snow - much-hyped dish @London's Pollen street Social. What makes it such a hit? The modern culinary technique employed to make it stunning and pleasurable looking, along with the lingering taste it brought about. At one point, I'd thought that I am eating it alive - the raw scallop slices were meaty and tasted sweet which further accentuated by the vinaigrette dressing. Floral-inpired; the teaser was dressed up in colorful petals and dills, accompanied with the semi-frozen cucumber slices - as beautiful as its name sounds. I am so captivated by the horseradish 'snow' - using new culinary technique; where the buttermilk was added to horseradish juice & thickened with cornstarch, thereafter frozen and pacotized, and later grated microscopically when served. This dish is as pleasing to the palate as to the eyes, I am hoping for some headphones to come along soon. A total bliss out.""PB&J"" - Peanut butter and cherry yuzu sorbet; topped the dessert list in London's flagship which I certainly wouldn't want to pass it up. Dreamy as it looked but serious in its taste! Sounds like a big diversion between the sweet peanut butter parfait & sour yuzu cherry sorbet, they duo did harmonize when eaten together. The after taste of yuzu has always been unique which I don't know what to make of it. Lara has been very creative when comes to plating - pomegranates, black raspberry & floral petals, everything looks so whimsical."

It's really something. The location can be a bit far in, but looking out, you can see the Singapore Flyer, the Singapore River, and the City - it really is pretty romantic and all. There's a buggy service to get there and back - to the Bayfront MRT station, etc. I thought that was a fantastic idea. NOTE: Please make reservation!What I Love: The service. It was impeccable. The staff were very, very intuitive and sensitive. They came with olives and bread - as a starter. Then, the drinks list (omg, this list is somethin' else), as the cocktails are brewed are made in the restaurant. I started the night with 2 (and yes, no judgement please) and they were fab. Fresh, decorated very nicely - the attention to detail was amazing. In every drink, there was a little flower - keeping with the theme of Gardens By The Bay and the Pollen-concept. I had one which had carrot juice in it - the other one a passion fruit blend.The cutlery and furniture were sleek and cool.Okay, now to the main part of this review, the food! The starters and mains were to die for. Apart from 3-4 types of bread, olives and cod puree as a general starter, we also had Crispy Baby Squid and the Slow-cooked-egg-chorizo-patatas bravas. For our mains, I had the Pork Belly (OMG) and my date had the Sea-bass. All the options were yummy.All the other stuff in the menu looked good too - but I didn't wanna overeat.The restaurant also has a direct, private access to the Gardens By The Bay exhibit.What I Don't Love: Price? But I do think for the quality of the ambiance, food and service, this place is okay. It will set you back at least $80-$100 per person. I know. (I'm just glad I didn't pay for that meal. Haha!)"

We ended up ordering:1) Murgh Makhni - Their version of butter chicken which is very well done.2) Prawns (don't remember what it was called) - I initially thought it was prawns cooked in the tandoor oven by itself which it is but also they add this sauce to it which tasted like I'm eating chinese food. The prawns were amazingly cooked and had great flavor but the sauce took a lot away for me.3) Paneer Tikka - Their Indian cheese dish - extremely well done. Loved it.4) Pani Puri - They had these Indian street food snack items as appetizers. Loved it!!5) Plain naan and rice - fluffy naan and rice was great. We ordered just enough not to get overly stuffed. Then for dessert, we ordered:1) Rasmalai - these cheese dumplings soaked in a milk type liquid. Indian staple dessert. It was ok.2) Gulab Jaman - best described as cake balls soaked in a sugary type liquid. Another Indian staple dessert, this was well done.3) Fig Kulfi - Indian ice cream with fig flavor. Surprisingly really good.The mango and sweet lassis both were pretty typical that you would find at any Indian restaurant. Always refreshing to get masala chai tea anywhere.The setting at this restaurant was on point and the food was very good. I would recommend this place over any other Indian restaurants in Singapore by far."

D and I love Indian food, but those curries in hawker centres or even the cheap $15 buffets seem very questionable. Perhaps its the sauce and spice-rich nature of Indian dishes that make me question whether a bug or two in an unsanitary kitchen haven't accidentally fallen and dissolved into its goodness. Sorry! that was disgusting. So here's Rang Mahal, an authentic, high-end Indian restaurant in Singapore that is delicious, clean, and superb in its service. On weekend lunch it becomes a buffet, at $50/person from 12pm-2pm, serving you a wide variety of Indian cuisine. The interior here is serene and simple, exactly as you would expect from a fine dining restaurant. I marked off one star for charging me $10 bucks for one glass of coke, without refills!

Most delish and the cooking is done with a light hand so you don't feel too bogged down after a meal.Love the pappadum basket with the various flavours - the black pepper one packs a sneaky heat and the one with fennel and cumin is very addictive. The quinoa is the best quinoa I've ever tasted. And the artichoke pakora is lovely despite the unexpected vegetable. The seafood is cooked a bit unevenly although the spicing levels are perfect. But it's a minor quibble. The service is a bit lacking for a restaurant of this caliber. There were quite a few waiters hustling around but it took effort to get them to come take our orders and to get their attention to pay the bill. And when my friend and I arrived, there was no one manning the podium out front. They need to brush up on that aspect of their restaurant. Great twist on familiar favourites.

Roland and his team elevate the Singapore seafood dining experience. Conveniently located on the East Coast on the top floor of the parking garage next to the Marine Parade NTUC Fair Price, dine on local favourites like chili and pepper crab, crunchy baby squid and stuffed dough sticks (yew char kway). First, the nosh. I enjoyed the flavourful boiled peanuts with black bean and sesame tones offered instead of the usual roasted kachang (roasted peanuts). They asked if we wanted tea. (Tip: They do not have chrysanthemum tea.) We decided to stay with water instead. They brought out an extensive menu filled with Chinese seafood dishes that I grew up with when I used to visit Seafood Road on East Coast Road (Long Beach, Palm Beach, Redhouse, nearby Golden Lion). I was transported back in time. They have lovely pictures in the menu that helped with my decision-making process. We ordered two large male crabs: chili crab and pepper crab, market price was $72 per kilogram. It was more than $10 less that the market price at restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Center. The chili crab sauce was to die for. We sopped it up with fried and steamed mantou (slightly sweet bread). The black pepper crab was tasty. The crab meat was sweet and tender, but I have had crab that was fatter and more meat. However, it could've been a seasonal thing. They might've just finished moulting.  The fried baby squid was heavenly. These half inch long morsels are sweet and savouring, serving up a distinct flavour and crunch. I felt sad that I didn't eat another plateful. Try it with a red chili sauce. Sweet and heat, Bobby Flay would've been proud.Another dish that had the sweet and heat thing going on was the fish paste stuffed fried dough stick (stuffed yew char kway). These come out hot and crispy. The fish paste was delicious. Dip it into the sweet flour and chili sauce that was hmmm, so good. My daughter licked it clean. They'd probably given us more sauce of we'd asked.Our last course was fried rice with tiny silver fish and crab. This dish was full of texture. I loved the crispiness of the fried fish that made the dish pop. I thought the crab was a little lost in the dish, but I enjoyed two bowls of it. I enjoyed eating it was a lightly seasoned plate of kailan greens.Just went I thought I could eat no more, they brought out orh nee, a traditional Teochew dessert or sweet taro paste. Unlike other orh nees that is sticky and oily, Roland's rendition is lighter and smoother, still maintaining its characteristic sweetness and slightly floral notes. My daughter enjoyed the light mango pudding with pomelo. That capped the evening on the highest note. It is one of the loveliest mango concoctions I have ever tasted. My daughter shyly asked for another round.While thinking about the food again makes me salivate, what sets Roland's apart is their service. When we made inquiries about the menu, the staff were friendly and hospitable, taking the time to go to the kitchen to answer our questions. When we made our reservations over the phone, they continued their extend their warm hospitality. Upon arrival, the maitre d' had our reservation on her list, then ushered us to a beautifully set smaller round tables. Roland's is a fantastic place to hold a banquet. The beautiful dining room is beautifully decorated with mirrors and lit low. The lights in the tanks added ambiance. Also, the restaurant is quieter than typical Chinese restaurants and conducive to conversations. The waitstaff were so attentive throughout the meal that I almost felt like I was at a French restaurant. Okay, I exaggerate a little, but still, they were super attentive and accommodating. It was a little surreal to be attended so closely while peeling and sucking on crab shells at the same time. However, I got over it very quickly. We couldn't finish our orh nee, and the wait staff quickly offered to package it home in a doggie bag for us. We all enjoyed our dining experience.Try Roland's for classy and comfortable way to enjoy Singapore seafood!"

Roland is a Singapore institution that is popular amongst the locals.As others have said, compared to other places, Roland's crab is more ""spicy"" than sweet, catering to a more authentic taste than other places that tend to have more of a tourist crowd. That said, I really enjoyed the chili crab and the group I was with ordered another!The atmosphere is nice - it's not overdone and you feel that you're in a ""Chili Crab""/Asian restaurant rather than some tourist joint. it's hard to describe, but once you look at the photos you'll understand. It has a really strong family vibe and, if you come late enough, you might be lucky to hear terrible Cantonese/Mandarin karaoke next door which only makes the experience feel more authentic!English is a bit hit and miss with some of the staff but it's manageable."

It's hard to imagine that this is indeed the case when you have other more known establishments such as Jumbo Restaurant, No Signboard Seafood, and Long Beach Seafood spread across the Red Dot. Make no mistake about it, however, this is one of the BEST places to grab Chilli Crab in Singapore. Located on top of a parking lot!?!? This is where the locals, particularly those who live in the East, get their Chilli crab. In terms of the Chilli Crab itself, I'll second what a fellow Yelper said in her review. Roland delivers a Chilli Crab that is more chilli than sweet, the way it ought to be done. Many restaurants cook their Chilli Crab in order to cater to a foreigners' sweet tooth (ahem, Jumbo). I wouldn't say the dish is spicy, but it did have some kick resulting a little bit of sweat coming down my forehead. :DThe other dishes were solid. The Baby Kai Lan was absolutely delicious, while the Seafood Food Fried Rice came up way short (I wasn't a big fan of the crunchy like topping they sprinkled on the Fried Rice).Overall, if you are a big fan of Chilli Crab, Roland is a must try!"

My best friends returned home from overseas and demanded to fulfill their Chilli crabs need. So I suggested to try Roland Restaurant, I mean they DID claim that they are the originator!! As the star dish of the night, I must say that their Chilli crab is indeed better than most I have eaten. This is because many restaurants cater to foreigners' taste buds and scale down their Chilli-ness to tomato sweet. Their sauce is thick with a hint of tomato sweet and yet still packed with even Chilli punch! Awesome!!!! The crabs themselves were fresh and meat was juicy and firm. Another star of the night has to be the Salted Egg Crab with yam. It's really salted egg sauce that's fried into the crab and they tossed in some yam fritters to give the dish extra crispiness, crunch and flavor!!! We had many other dishes and all beautifully done. As my best friend said at the end of the meal, ""Roland knows how to do it right"". The meal is not cheap but we had Sea Bass and drunken prawns and Broccoli with Scallops so it's rather worth the cost. Definitely bringing my family to try."

While food was good, as it should be at an establishment such as this, the service was shockingly dismal. For starters, they forgot to omit an ingredient one of our party was allergic to, even after we specified before dinner started. No apology given other than blaming it on the kitchen who forgot. In one instance, when the dish was set, an uncomfortably long silence ensued, and the waitstaff took the menu and just read it. The desserts were served exceedingly slowly. We saw that they came out of the kitchen and was waiting to be served to our table. When they finally arrived after about 5 minutes just sitting at the side, all the dry ice (and the effects of the dry ice) was gone, leaving behind a pool of water!In addition, kitchen staff engaged with friends from the table directly behind us. For 45 minutes, they were standing, talking loudly, and milling about behind our table. It was uncomfortable as the restaurant space was small. We understand that diners want a good time, and tables may be noisy at times. However, that this was instigated and sustained by a staff member at the expense of other diners is unacceptable.When feedback was offered at the end of the meal, the chef was not interested and asked if he could leave the conversation. The front of house staff called the next day after reviewing the video from the camera at the restaurant. They did offer to send a cake and flowers to the person we were celebrating for, but we felt service recovery was poor, especially after the fact that they were uninterested the night before. We declined their offer for the cake and flowers. Will not return as there are many options elsewhere with better food and service."

It's $120 and it used to be less back when inflation wasn't so crazy but at least you're paying for good edomae sushi and it's cheaper than flying to Tokyo for Sushi Sho. As this was a business lunch, I couldn't take any pictures or mentally note down my thoughts on the food (yes I wish I was that good at multi-tasking but this brain is aging).I thought the meal as a whole was pleasant, service was well paced and we tried a decent range of sushi. The meal started with a delicious Japanese tomato cut like a flower, which put a smile on my face. We also had some pickled shellfish that I couldn't quite make out but it was fresh, firm and tasty. For the main sashimi and sushi courses, the former had the standard Singapore crowd-pleasing fishes while the sushi was more interesting. There seemed to be a skew towards red and white fish, which could be due to seasonality or the chef's preference. If I'm not mistaken, there was shima-aji (amberjack) with ginger and kisu (whiting) as well as a fairly balanced and sweet chutoro; along with standards like cucumber and tamago. The soup was great too. In all, the meal was elegant, simple and light, which is great for lunch."

The fact that it never gets crowded even during lunch/dinner time makes it even better (I still book it pre-arrival just to be safe though). I am not from Sichuan but it is definitely one of my most favorite Chinese cuisines, so we have looked almost all over Singapore for authentic Sichuan food at a decent place. That means the food has to be mostly hot as blazes from Sichuan peppers, which are different from chili peppers. It will still wither your mouth but these peppers have a natural chemical that gives a little bit of numbness. I personally don't take extremely hot flavor on a daily basis or in general except for Sichuan food (by the way you can opt for less spicy).My faves:Spicy cold steamed chicken with cashew nuts $20Chen's Mapo Doufu $20 *perfect with Hokkaido riceStewed fish fillet in super-hot Szechwan pepper sauce $26Sautéed chilli pepper and chicken $22I've tried many Sichuan restaurants in China as well as US and this is one of the restaurants that I have found really authentic. I've been going here for more than 10 times in less than a year. The interior is very beautiful and classy. Servers are attentive and the food is consistently high quality. This place is perfect for the atmosphere to impress a date or client especially if you know that they love real Sichuan food so much! Meals are a la carte in medium sizes to share mostly but they have three options for set menu that start from $68 per person. On a la carte section, one dish is typically $12-25 on average which I think is very affordable for the ambiance, location and food quality. If you order one per person and then share it's not hard to have a generous meal with some tasty leftovers to take home."

This was like Hainanese chicken, but all shredded up and given a spicy twist. Absolute must try.2) Grilled Wagyu Beef ($30): beautifully burnished and glossed with a delicate garlicky spice blend. Sumptuous, albeit forgettable. The earlier starter really stole the limelight. 3) Hot & Sour Soup ($12): exceptional, punchy and robust, but finished with an exquisite polish 4) Braised Corn Soup with Crabmeat ($12): skip this, it was insipid and clunky.5) Roasted Crispy Chicken ($46 for whole and promotionally half-priced on Thursday lunches): outstanding. For once, I actually only ate the breast meat, which was wonderfully moist and flavoursome6) Sweet & Sour Pork with Black Vinegar ($26): A galfriend thought it was ""too porky"", but I thought it was acceptably full-bodied. The one thing we all could agree on, was that the heady, sweetish, piquant glaze was absolutely delightful.7) Chen's Mapo Doufu ($22): hearty but restrained.

The restaurant seats all of eight people, although most of the action is closest to one side, so four people get the full experience before their eyes, the others have to glance to the left more.Everything is artfully done. Appetizer of baby corn, greens, and itty bitty fish is followed by a sashimi plate-- in this case was geoduck (?), flounder, and a superb jack mackerel. Uni atop botan ebi followed, holy crap-- so good. Next was a golden eye snapper with ponzu and what seemed like some sort of chopped veggie (almost like pico de gallo) atop, showing some innovation.Singapore's claim to fame, hair crab quarter, deliciously stuffed was next. Almost but not quite mind blowing. A very standard sea bream was next... don't let standard fool you, just because everyone does it, it's still good. Next was a crab (?) or something, I forget. Lightly grilled, very nice compared to the typical raw. Grilled sabrefish was unique and a very pleasant addition. Might have been a spanish mackerel next, I'm ashamed to say I didn't write it down! Mantis shrimp was another new one, I don't know if it was stuffed with something or it was how mantis shrimp is, but this was the one dish that was different that I didn't care for. Three different courses of tuna followed-- maguro, chutoro, and a charcoal-seared otoro. All very, very good. Watching your otoro seared before your eyes with real charcoal (!!!).A gentle palate cleanser next, although some might find it a bit strong. Baby tomato, okra, not sure what else.Cooked shrimp mixed things up, then a plate of both cooked abalone and clam, with yuzu pepper. I don't normally care for abalone, but this was excellent. Catfish (?) atop rice came next, quite a bit more delicate than I normally take for catfish. Long spike uni followed-- YUM, although the combination dish of ikura and uni that followed was even better-- almost perfect, and the ikura wasn't too salty, as so many places make the mistake.A clam miso soup was delicate but perhaps the most out of character thing, for some reason the clam-iness didn't do it for me either. A brilliant sweet tamago followed, then a chopped tuna/shiso leaf/brown rice hand roll just to keep your palate rolling!The real desert finally came, I think it was a lightly glazed honeydew and cantaloupe. Delicious.Some complain about service being a little sterile, and to be fair, it is. They greet you by name upon entrance and everything is entirely proper, so I wouldn't complain too much-- but then when you're dining at a 2* establishment and paying this kind of money, I fully understand the complaints.In the end, it's an easy rating on Yelp. You can get almost as good for half the money, though, and that is definitely a thought that weighs heavily enough to prevent Shoukouwa from getting a 5-star Yelp rating."

And I'm afraid it didn't live up to those expectations. I had dinner on a weekday evening. Reservations had to be secured with a credit card booking - pre paid. There were two options for dinner: $320 vs the pricier $480. We opted for the former. Which included:- appetizer of stewed grated yam with shirako in it (for the uninitiated, shirako is cod sperm. And it's in season!)- steamed crab with its roe and guts, dipping sauce of vinegar lime with sharks fins (!!! )- filefish sushi with its liver atop it- buri sushi- steamed sea perch with chopped scallions and garlic(?) in light soy sauce - baby shrimp sushi (can't recall its Japanese name)- shima aji sushi- grilled kinmedai- akami zuke (marinated maguro) sushi - chutoro sushi- aburi chutoro sushi (yes, with coals, not a blow torch)- persimmon in sesame paste palate cleanser- deep fried file fish in dashi broth- mategai sushi (most likely but can't be absolutely certain it was mategai and not another type of clam)- sayori (needlefish) sushi- sawara (Spanish mackerel) sushi. Lightly smoked. - murasaki uni sushi - anago sushi - miso soup- ""maki"" of sorts of toro and chopped scallions- rice dish of uni, ikura and caviar on uni mixed rice- Japanese fruits : melon and pearSo, interspersed with the sushi dishes were cooked seafood dishes. The shari was perfect, spot on. Yes for some of the fish it was vinegared with red darker ones, for the lighter white fish sushi, ""normal"" vinegar was used. Whatever it was, it had the perfect mix of stickiness and bite. To be honest there was nothing to fault re: the sushi. Each was made with the right amount of shari, packed with just the perfect firmness, brushed with soy sauce, use your fingers and enjoy! Hmm!The cooked dishes were mostly good except the kinmedai, which I felt was a waste to have it cooked -- with a sweet miso sauce I think. It was just, ok. Shoukouwa, in my opinion, pales in comparison with Shinji and Hashida (I have yet to try Sushi Ichi). Both Shinji and Hashida exude warmth-- in the decor, of warm wood and colours and large cypress wood table top and lighting, and service from both staff and sushi chefs. Shoukouwa was very masculine. Granite walls and some wood. Lighting wasn't warm. Not one staff (visible to customers at least) was female -- ok, not that it really matters, but one of the wait staff (the only non Japanese)  wasn't spot on 100% warm and friendly, look-in-the-eye professional service type one would expect. The seating of the restaurant meant that only a lucky two or four at most would get the best seats, watching the chef prepare the sushi. The other four (it was only a 8 seater long counter) would be watching quite faraway. I was seated right at the end, and right next to the curtain flap separating the kitchen. So yes, slightly noisy. There wasn't such an issue at Shinji or Hashida because of the design of the dining rooms. The sushi chef: there were two, one assisting the main. They were initially stern looking, not really being friendly other than the usual irrashimasu! I had to ask questions, about sushi, the chunks of fish, how long they were marinated or aged for, etc, before they became just slightly friendlier. Still not great. It's like as if they were reluctant to chat. Part of the experience at a sushi ya is watching the chef prepare the fish and sushi etc. there has to be a grace, even if there were more customers. He became hurried, and tossed some fish chunks into the boxes etc to get the sushi made. And that affected the speed at which our sushi was presented. Too quickly. I suppose it is a good thing we didn't have to wait too long for the next course, etc, and most of the time it was fine, but sometimes the sushi was presented one after another. I barely had time to have a piece of ginger before the next sushi was made and it just had to be eaten immediately! So these few negatives detracted from the experience. Which was otherwise good: Ocha (during meal) and houjicha (during dessert) were perfect complement to the food, the tamago was probably the best I've ever had, the sushi were all delicious -- I particularly enjoyed the akami zuke, the buri, filefish, and the uni dishes. But would I return? No. Would I recommend a meal at Shoukouwa? No. please have a meal at Shinji or Hashida instead. For the same price, it is much better there than Shoukouwa. I don't understand the Michelin stars at all. I award shoukouwa three stars because of the price, and the Michelin stars. If it was unstarred and slightly less pricier, it would have achieved a 4. Still not a 5."

I'm not sure why people would classify the restaurant as pricey when given the quality of the food, portions, decor and service, it really is the farthest thing from pricey. If one refers to the absolute price of the food, I think its a foregone conclusion when eating fine dining anything. Unless you catch your own abalone and other treasures yourself I guess... Anyway if that prevailing view works in my favor i.e. less people fighting for good seats in the house, I'm all ears :PWe had one of the set menu's (can't remember if it was peony or jade or something) and extended it to 8 people and swapped one of the dishes. It worked out to about $110 per person and we got:- suckling pig AND roast duck for starters- a brimming bowl of treasures each (diced abalone, ham etc soup with a very generous chunk of bird's nest on top)- broccoli with plump and juicy scallops kissed by XO and dried scallops- the best salted egg yolk prawns with asparagus - crunchy and rich without being overwhelming- a very fresh and large steam soon hock- light, but flavorful glutinous rice...annnnd nian gao + one of those light herbal jelly/aloe vera type desserts to finish the feast.

Portion was just nice for us, if not a bit too much. They also have dim sum in the afternoon, for those who want some Chinese afternoon tea.Service was excellent. While it is a Chinese restaurant, they assigned an English speaking staff to us without prompting - most likely because we made our reservations in English and they took note.

It's a decent sized counter for around 14 people with a solid crew of sushi chefs. The setup appears very similar to that of both Shinji locations and quite frankly, if you slapped the Shinji name on Ichi, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Ichi is also based in Ginza, like Shinji, but although both Singaporean Michelin Stars are eerily similar, Ichi does have much better service and creativity.In order to dine at Shinji, you need to go to the Marriott Tang Plaza and walk to what looks like a quaint Japanese house. From the main hostess counter, you open the sliding door to your right and are welcomed by a 14 seater bar and 3 energetic chefs. After being seated, you are presented with both the drink and food menus, the latter offers you three selections of a nigiri sushi focused omakase, a mini omakase, or a big boy full cooked dishes and sushi omakase.A friend and I did the sushi nigiri option since our stomachs were already hating us from a full Bacchanalia ""omakase"" from earlier in the day. So keep this in mind about my review, I only did sushi.The service was excellent. The sushi was great as you would expect with a nice textured vinegar rice that almost looks like brown rice. Since we were first timers at Ichi, we received the typical toro, snapper, mackerel, and all of the usual nigiri that chefs give patrons they don't know. They also included a nice ikura, uni and HAIRY CRAB course which I was a big fan of.There are so many top tier sushi places around Orchard Road that you really can't go wrong with and Sushi Ichi is no exception. Frankly, I can't figure out what criteria Michelin gave to award the One Star Sushi spots with their respective stars other than they are all in hotel properties and have Ginza sister restaurants.

My friends and I could not decide what to eat and made our choice the typical Singaporean way - by heading for the stall with the longest queue at Tai Wah Pork NoodlesThere was a queue of at least 7 people in front of us when we started queueing and the wait was long (and excruciating since we were all rather starved). The uncle cooking the noodles is quite old and hence, speed isn't the shop's forte. I have to say that the noodles were cooked to perfection - great texture and very springy, and that sorts of justifies the wait. They are also rather generous with their lard servings so for those who love those crispy pillows of lard, this stall would make you pretty happy.

But the definite must try is their ""kong bak pau"" - marinated pork belly meat in a smooth bun. These are tiny too, like their chair siew pau counterparts. But unlike the normal kong bak paus, instead of a huge slab of meat, the meat in this bun is nicely shredded yet retaining that moist, flavorful fat.

Most of the food we get now are often factory made or from a central kitchen. So it is such a treat to be able to savor food which is made the traditional painstaking way. I first tried the char siew bao a few years ago when my colleague gave me one to try. It was tiny but packed with lip-smacking delicious char siew filling. It was not very fatty and had the right ratio of bun and meat. It was 50 cents then. The price has gone up to 60 cents for the bao (small) and $1.20 for the big bao. Some may feel that it is expensive for something which can be devoured in one mouthful or two bites but I think it is quite alright for something which is handmade and tastes so good. The big bao (pork) is not very big compared to other places but I think the size is just nice for a snack or light meal. The meat inside is juicy and the sauce coats the interior of the bao perfectly so you do not get the feeling of dryness at all. Beware the small bao as you may just keep popping them into your mouth as they are just so good. It is definitely better when served fresh off the steamer.

Their paus are tiny. Tiny red bean paus, chicken paus, char siew paus and even kong bak paus. Even their siew mais are tiny. And as the their name states, they are all handmade and started by Mr Yeoh who is Teochew. They also sell fan choy (glutinous char siew rice) and lor mai kai (glutinous chicken rice), which fortunately arent tiny. Prices may feel a little steep, after all for the same 60 cents, you can get a much bigger pau elsewhere. But the novelty and the fact that the paus are actually very yummy makes up for it. Their siew mais are particular yummy because instead of prawns they use fish and instead of crab roe they use carrots. A lot healthier than a standard siew mai but just as tasty.Business is brisk especially the more popular items like the kong bak paus and the lotus paste paus. You can actually call in to pre-order to avoid disappointment.  I've always been proud to be a teochew because teochews are famous for many local food like fried carrot cake, fried kway teow, kway chap, teochew porridge, etc. Although pau isnt exactly exclusively a teochew specialty, it is still a prime example of good teochew made food here in Singapore.Their opening hours are Tuesday to Saturday - 6:00am to 2:00pm and Sunday - 6:00am to 12:00pm."

The food is definitely above average but I would say that it lacks the surprises I get from Candlenut where I feel the presentation of the food and the combination of ingredients and flavors are all perfect.  It is definitely not bad but is also not my go-to place.  Nevertheless, it's a good option considering the lower prices in general."

The Beef Rendang is something that is on par with your friendly neighbourhood makcik's best efforts... chunks of beef in a dark maroon gravy (careful! it's so good that you might find yourself licking the plate clean) that's been sitting in a stew enriched with shallots, chilli peppers, lemon grass, turmeric, coconut, and galangal for more than four hours... Servings are larger than at the Grandma's Restaurants on Orchard, where they are puny and never enough, and they come up to about the same price-tag (and taste a LOT better).Other must-orders are the Otak-otak (shiok as hell!), with the lemongrass so freshly potent that your nostrils will be flaring in pleasure, and the Deep-fried Brinjal in Sambal...

A particularly easy place for Westerners to dine as the menu is varied without being too extensive, and the descriptions are well written with certain items identified as special recommendations. The price level is higher than what you would expect at a 'local joint' but less than those of many of the other 'westernised' eateries' we visit. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, but stand outs were the whole sambal fish, the chicken rolls and the prawns. The whole fish is a little intimidating when it first arrives at the table but just get stuck in! The sweet sambal over the crispy fried skin... dericious! I also am a sucker for sago pudding with gula melaka... not bad here, but the sago had congealed a bit more than necessary and I prefer it without the ice shavings. Service is polite and attentive. Decor is a bit dated (I thought) but in keeping with a traditionalist theme and  far from off-putting. Their wine and beer list could probably be widened a bit more, especially wine by the glass. We spent $60 per person for starters, mains and two drinks each. I think this is a great place to bring visitors to give them a taste of peranakan cuisine. Next I want to try Peranaman and then off to Melaka for the graduation of peranakan cuisine!"

The cuisine is described as peranankan (the mixure of chinese and malay that is typical for the singapore chinese), but I suspect this is a means to present a cuisine that is really a fusion of the different cultures of Southeast Asia. No matter: the result is excellent. I had chicken in an Indonesian sauce based on nuts I did not know but that were delicious - chocolate like (ayam buah keluak), and my companion had pork knuckles braised to perfection in another herb mix (babi hong). Both tasted delicious and I certainly go back for more. Even the rice on itself was perfumed in a way I didn't recognize. All in all, we had an excellent meal - the best I had in this area of Singapore. And the prices were - by European standards - certainly affordable.

Each dish is clearly labeled (especially with ingredients so if you have any food allergies you can avoid them). They also served local desserts and ice cream. Of course you could find better quality food at specific hawker locations or restaurants, but if you dont have time to hit various locations, this was a central location allowing my friend to have small samples and go in for repeats. The buffet also doesnt have a time limit, so we were there from 11:30am till 2:30pm (when they close).

(The Peranakan Special Edition)I have wanted to dine at Clifford Pier for ages. It's a gorgeous restaurant in a gorgeous hotel, with an even more gorgeous view, so when The Clifford Pier promoted that they were having a Peranakan Cuisine showcase by guest Chef Philip Chia, I knew we had to give it a try. The menu isn't extensive, just the highlights of Peranakan Food like Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Pongteh and Nonya Chap Chye but with all the essentials there, it was enough for us to give it a shot. Ayam Buah Keluak ($28) The benchmark of any Peranakan Reataurant has to be the Ayam Buah Keluak. You can usually determine how good or bad your dinner is going to be from the way this dish was prepared and it was no different here. The sauce was very fragrant and very good. Lighter and slightly more watery than those I'm used to, it still had distinctive taste from the Rempah (spice blend) with a hint of the Buah Keluak. The Buah Keluak itself was something special. We're used to having it either as it is, or with the ""meat"" dug out , mixed with minced pork and stuffed back in but this one was special. They dug it out, mixed with with the rempah before stuffing it back in the shell. This made the Buah Keluak meat very flavorful and less pungent, which is good for beginners. Only thing is the way they cracked the shell. We usually open it down the side but because the opened it at the top and made it a pretty small opening (smaller than the teaspoon give), it made it very difficult to dig out the filling with a knife. The let down though was the chicken. They gave three chunky pieces of thigh yet every piece was cooked till it was dry and tough. Very very disappointing. Babi Pongteh ($28)Another easily recognizable Peranakan dish, the Babi Pongteh is a wonderful stewed pork dish with a bean paste. The flavours again was very nice. The sauce was fragrant and wonderfully thickened by the fat from the pork belly. It is a bit sweeter that the Pongtehs that I'm used too but it wasn't by any means overpowering. The problem again was the cook of the meat. While the fat was wonderfully melt in your mouth and the meat around the fat was tender and juice, it got extremely dry and tough as you reached the bottom. Another case of overcooked protein. Nonya Chap Chye ($18)Probably Peranakans most well-know vegetable dish, a Nonya chap Chye is more than just putting vegetable together and boiling it in a pot. There's a lot of care that goes into it with each vegetables different cook time. The key to any Chap Chye is ensuring the sweetness of the cabbage shine yet allowing strong flavors of the fermented soya bean and dried Beancurd skin to come come through. Too much or little of either and it'll lose the balance of the dish. The version served here is easier on the palette for those who do not like the taste of beancurd skin or fermented bean paste. It's naturally sweet   With that hint of saltiness from the bean paste, however, I hate to eat it again and again but.......... It was overcooked!The cabbage was mushy, the carrots were so soft I could mash it with my tongue and even the black fungus, that normally offers a nice crunch to the otherwise soft texture, was cooked till I could break it apart without biting. Lemon Barely ($5)This had to be the most natural tasting lemon barleys I've ever had. No artificial, cordial lemon barely here. It was straight up boiled barley drink (yes with the cooked barley in the glass), rock melon and lemon juice. A good way to counter the richness and spiciness of the Peranakan dishes. On a whole, the dining experience was decent but certainly not 5 star quality. The ongoing trend here was that, while the flavors were good, the main protein and veg were all over cooked. Chicken, pork, vege, all cooked way over than it should be. I understand the need to leave them in the flavor the dish but there's a ceiling and unfortunately, all the dishes here went way way way over it. Oh and unfortunately, service wasn't up to standard too. 1) servers were not strategically placed. It took a while to get someone's attention as all the wait staff were near the entrance while we were near the rear. 2) they were preparing for an event outside. I know there's a need to have background music but a. Did they really need to blast the music and fill hall with bass-y chill out longer music? Considering that the guest hadn't even arrive? b. To rectify the issue, they ended up turning up the ambient music in the restaurant! Not till it was deafening because we could still talk but to a point that it was above the comfort range. So overall: Venue: 5*Ambience: 3* (thanks to he music) Service: 3* Food: 3* I would love to give this experience a 4 but I'll wait till my next visit before determining."

The other one is called Clifford Restaurant so look out!This place is a beautiful dining hall overlooking the MBS side, with nice chandeliers, big big vases of white orchids, and soft background music playing by a live band (for dinner). It is a very, very pleasant experience to dine here. Service here is impeccable, and waitstaff are attentive and prompt.Let's come to the important bit. The food.Cuisine here is Singaporean hawker food, served with an upmarket touch. The prices here are a steep mark-up from the usual hawker fare, so be prepared to shell out some heavy dough. I came here with a companion and we started with two popiah rolls (thin crepes stuffed with turnip, prawns, egg) ($12). I had the laksa with lobster ($36), which I enjoyed, apart from it not having cockles... My grouse was that my laksa was not Instagram-worthy, with bits of chopped lobster scattered in the laksa. Come on guys, for 36 bucks++ the laksa better look good.My companion had fried snapper with brinjal/eggplant. He rated it 6/10. You have to order rice separately, which is $5 extra, but you have a choice between white and brown rice, which is freeflow. Pretty sweet. I like the brown rice option. Plus point for having healthier choices!We ended the meal with a key lime pie for him, and an ice kacang for me.The key lime pie was good, and had a good digestive crust. They were very accommodating when I mentioned I didn't want peanuts and red beans inside my ice kacang. The ice kacang differs from the hawker one - the ice is very finely blended/ground, so that it is soft and is melt-in-the-mouth, unlike the crunchy feel from the hawker ice kacang. Our bill for two came up to 200 because we had two beers and a glass of champagne (they sell Perrier Jouet by the glass ehre ($30)). If you don't drink, I think this meal is still affordable - comparable to a normal restaurant meal.Would I come back? Maybe. Definitely not getting alcohol next time!"

The rice is really infused with coconut flavor and is not overly strong. The flavor also does not taste synthetic like some other places. I will suggest to just get the nasi lemak and maybe a lemongrass drink. That is light and refreshing. The nasi lemak comes with sambal (not too sweet or spicy), fried egg with runny yolk (not all the time), cucumber, crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts and two pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken is yummy, the best thing next to the rice. The side dishes are ok, not that special or fantastic to warrant the prices. Same for the desserts.

Of course, I still thought it was utterly overpriced, but for a nice restaurant in Club Street with a/c and yummy food? Aiight, I'll pay for it.I went on a Friday night and got a seat right away which is a nice change for Club Street that's always bustling and with people spilling onto the street. Service was fairly prompt, and it would have been nice to have the specials on the board instead of me having to ask if the menu was all there is to it and then the server then filling in the gaps on their specials of the day.I ordered the nasi lemak (of course) and the sayur lemak (which is apparently the less creamy version of sayur lodeh - it certainly tasted that way too) which was one of the specials. The nasi lemak came out looking delicious! The rice was coconut-y and fragrant, the egg was a nice oozy crisp, the ikan bilis was fried without being too hard, the chilli was a little too much on the spicy side (and just not as delicious as the one at Adam Road) and the chicken was glorious. The chicken was a full thigh and drumstick, was marinated in this delicious marinade (lots of local herbs - lemongrass and the like) and fried to juicy perfection. Yum. The sayur lemak had a really good broth - possibly ikan bilis? I made the unfortunate mistake of mixing all the chilli into it and ended up sniffling my way through my meal although it was really quite delicious. Although they also serve alcohol, my dining companion and I both got the lemongrass tea which was serviceable.This was all-in-all a very satisfying meal, and although I might still return to Adam Road for my nasi lemak fix (at a much lower price point too), I wouldn't say no to anyone asking me to get nasi lemak if I were ever in the Club Street area."

I had opted for the veg tasting menu while my husband chose the non-veg tasting menu. The interior of the restaurant is very weirdly oriented and has few private rooms too. I liked the open kitchen concept. There was just one complimentary starter of bread roll which was very bland & definitely not the best taste to keep me wanting for more. The service was very mediocre & definitely not upscale of that a Michelin dining experience. Food was hit or miss, nothing to make me feel wow. They never changed the cutleries nor cleaned the table of the crumbs. I couldn't find any difference of food-taste or style or presentation or service that could justify its Michelin rating. The worst part was to find a dead ant on the rim of the glass where some gravy was served! Although the manager came & apologized, nothing was offered as complimentary to compensate for that worse experience. I have dined in several Michelin restaurants in different parts of the world to state that this could have been a normal Indian restaurant. What I liked was the starter.. which was a mix platter of samosa, veg patties & gol gappas. In the main course, okra fry & daal was good! My husband loved his chicken tikka gravy. In the dessert option, I really enjoyed the beet root halwa. In short, the food can be hit or miss... don't go here with Michelin dining mindset but just an ordinary Indian restaurant. I don't think I would like to return again, there are far better restaurants in this country to enjoy."

The lighting was perfect and it just makes you feel rich just by being there. It's set in an old Singaporean Bungalow-ish home so thats pretty unique.Now the food. Was honestly one of the best North Indian food I have ever tasted and that's coming from a South Indian. The food was cooked perfectly and I didn't feel like there was much room for improvement. There were Indian desserts, side dishes, main courses and just being there and eating their food which is so rich in flavor just made you feel like a king. The customer service was great and all the waiters were smartly dressed so I have no comment on that. Only problem is there might be a bit of a jam in the road outside this area but that isn't because this restaurants is well known. It's because it's located in the city area or at least, close to the city area.  So if you are looking for an Indian Restaurant to bring your partner out on a date, look no further! This restaurant is perfect for the two of you. Although quite pricey, the food is definitely worth it."

The setting is elegant, and much pride has obviously gone into the decor and comfortable furnishing. It's a bit of a pity that more people don't patronise the restaurant. Indeed, when I was there for lunch one weekday, there were only three tables filled, including ours. There was a buffet going on at an attractive rate, and we partook in the offer - a rather wide spread of curries, naans, meats, vegetables, biryani and even dessert. Food was well executed even for a buffet standard, and there were vegetarian friendly options. The naans are a little on the chewier side than what I'm used to though. My only other gripe was that the servers were a little too keen to clear off the buffet items on the dot. A quick flip through the menu evidenced that the a la carte dishes were on the pricy side though. I suppose with the addition of wine, your credit card might smoke a little at the end of your meal. Parking is easy, given that there are ample lots around the bungalow (and not many customers around)."

The rice was so-so, lacking the fragrance of chicken rice. The roasted chicken was not too bad, tender and deboned, making it easy to eat. Plus there was no layer of fats under the skin. The chili sauce which was the critical component of a good chicken rice was a bit mild. It did not have the oommph to take it to the next level, likewise for the ginger.

It was great food served in a great ambiance.  But, it felt like a fast food experience.If my second trip had matched my first one, I would be giving True Blue five stars.  My next trip will determine if they should retain their current four stars.The food is amazing.  The flavors are great.  The presentation is very good.  The room is beautiful.  There just needs to be more attention given to the overall experience."

Last night we dined with a couple of friends of my cousin who are in town for business.  Luckily they are adventurous eaters.  They did have trouble finding it but seemed to enjoy the plush surrounds.  We sat in the corner with a full view of the restaurant and the china collection cabinet.  We ordered our favorites: the banana blossom & cucumber salad, sweet potato leaves, okra in candlenut sauce, black nut chicken, fried chicken in Indonesian spices, and beef rending.  The dishes came out of the kitchen at a steady pace.  Rice and tea were refilled plentifully.  I drank so much of the red date & longan tea that I had a mild sugar high mid meal. I cannot speak highly enough of the banana salad.  I have never been able to identify the banana blossom in the dish but the sauce is so good I don't really care what is in it.  I usually polish off the dish myself while people focus their attention elsewhere.  Like hollowing out their black nuts and chicken.  This is another stunning dish here.  The chicken is infused with more of the black nit flavor than other versions of this dish I have tasted.  The beef rending is simply superb.  I don't care for fried chicken but our guests fought over the last piece so it must have been delicious. plates clean the dessert came: pineapple tarts and some mango puree and pomelo for me. I hadn't gotten enough of pomelo from the juice which was amazing.  The pineapple tarts are homemade and you can tell.  Our guests commented that it didn't taste like pineapple at all. Either way, they ate them with delight.  We sat for a long time after the meal in deep conversation about the country.  The atmosphere in this restaurant makes you want to talk about important things.  After holding the table for over two hours we departed.  But it won't be long before I'm back for that salad."

Gorgeous artwork such as the beaded slippers are displayed in one of the rooms, while another houses a breathtaking array of lace blouses. The ground floor seating area is the main hall, while a few private rooms upstairs and one on the ground floor are popular for wedding ceremonies and private events.Pity then that the food and service appear indifferent and lacking in soul. Ayam buah keluak was the best dish, while everything else really failed to exhibit depth of flavour. The beef rendang was tough and barely warm when it hit the table, the chap chye watery. Prawns petai style were not fresh and lacked in sambal. Oh and if you want extra sambal, you will have to pay for it. Not surprising then with the small sizes of the dishes that the bill quickly adds up. Desserts were overhyped; the ""best pineapple tart in Singapore"" was mediocre with its dried out jam centre not yielding any moistness.This is a really beautiful restaurant to bring overseas guests, but only the connoisseur will know that there are smaller, more boutique Peranakan restaurants serving far better quality dishes."

Everyone has an opinion on how the best prawn Mee should taste like.Believe me when I said that I've tried many ""famous"" places since the 80s till now. Shops have come and gone, newer ones or the better marketed (through social media or word of mouth) has made their way to the limelight and are sometimes over hyped. I'm caught in between opinions when it comes to this store and here's my experience -I was lucky enough to join the queue on a Saturday morning minutes before noon and only queued about 30mins for this ( I heard it can be up to an hour plus). The stall is runned by an elderly couple. The uncle prepares all the food in the background and the Aunty takes orders and collect the cash. I heard the Aunty can get a little grumpy but with all grumpy old folks I don't really take any offence and laugh it off as cute.""Aunty! 2 $10 bowl! 1Meepok 1kwaytiao! Dry ah! :)""""Don't have $10 already! Sold out! Got $15! Today the prawn very good! Fresh and big! Ah!""""Ok la Aunty! Gimme 2 $15 bowl then la :D""I then proceed to wait another 5-7mins before receiving 2 bowls of dried chilli noodles and another 2 mini woks of 3 giant prawns each. Verdict: Soup indeed tastes very healthy. You can distinctively taste the sweetness of the boiled prawn heads in the broth. However I'm used to having my soup a little bit more on the saltier side when it comes to prawn Mee. (I guess I grew up that way) their dry noodles are like your usual market type Mee pok with chilli or kway teow with chilli. Nothing special. The star of the show goes to the prawns! They were big! They were juicy! They were cruncy! Not the least bit dry and cooked to absolute perfection! If you are craving for damn good prawns without going to a seafood restaurant, this is THE PLACE!But with the long wait, and location... It's not something that tells me ""I MUST come back IMMEDIATELY"" after I've had my last scoop of soup.Maybe in a few months times perhaps..

I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (""Ghin"" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!"

Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu."

It will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it's just so much food. Also, be sure to set aside 3.5 to 4 hours to dine here, it's long. Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable. I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the ""menu"", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal. You say OK and move on with your culinary journey.Both of my experiences, I had essentially the same dishes (I believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season). I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience."

At least they had phone charger for my poor Android phone..*also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi :(( but o well i guess u can't choose in omakase."

The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time. I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place. The staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests."

Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening."

Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu.  The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience.  In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world.  Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff.  To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side.  Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space.  Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening.  Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms.  This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu.  We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us.  I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list.  If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat.  I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive!  At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along.  I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food.  Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth!  Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction.   Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert.  The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening.  We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening.  A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience.  From the food, to the decor, to the service.  This is seamless top class dining.  This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come."

(And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ /10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite.  For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well."

Each dish is a feast for you eyes and was unique and delicious in its own right. I would highly recommend doing the wine pairing with this tasting menu as just one bottle is not going to pair with all dishes. We really enjoyed trying all the wines.

It consisted of nori cream made with creme fraiche and nori, compressed cucmber sphere, cured trout roe, chrysanthemum petals, puffed wild rice, toasted nori, cherry bell radish, and dashi jelly. It was a party in the mouth.Roasted Mangalica pork jowl, sea scallop xo, braised wombok, land seaweedInterestingly the scallop was flattened into translucent silky sheet, which looked similar to Liang fen ??, but it still retained the scallop's seafood taste.

The pork was fork tender and flavourful.Line caught red seabream, sago porridge, fermented celeriac, young herbs, umami butterThe dish was prettily served topped with cucumber's flowers. The sago porridge sat on a pool of herb oil, topped with the fish. The sago porridge was creamy and crunchy with vegetables in it. It smelt umami when served.Australian berries, young coconut mousse, lychee granita, dried milkThe mousse was light not too sweet, which was quite balance with the slightly tart berries.The meal ended with a serving of petite four which consisted of a macaron and a tart with crispy noodle like base.I also ordered a cup of latte ($7++) to go with it.Overall the food was delicious and unique in its own way."

The original and simplest is the prawn mee, but you can also opt for pork rib, liver, etc. They come in 4 to 5 different sizes to please all palates.

After you order, you're given a laminated number in which the owner will shout out in Mandarin and English when your order is ready.

I had fun paging through it all, but I knew what I wanted the minute I saw it: crispy oatmeal tofu. It's listed as their ""classic bestseller,"" so I couldn't wait. I also ordered a side of rice.The dish was yum. The blend of spices and fragrances were amazing. The tofu was nice, and I'm picky about my tofu.My only real complaint was that the whole dish was super-dry. It's like, take a bunch of dry crunchy oat flakes and some dry tofu, throw some spices on them, and put them on a plate. No sauces whatsoever. While the spices were exquisite, the total dryness of the food was a bit strange. Even just a hint of sauce would've made it much nicer.If you're vegan, make sure to verify that your dish contains no dairy or egg or honey. (They do use dairy in some of their desserts and things.)The atmosphere here was a little sterile and corporate, and the price was a definitely on the high side for lunch, but it's pretty centrally located (not far from the Tanjong Pagar station), the food is interesting, and it's definitely worth a visit if you're curious to try some Peranakan vegetarian food.Note that they are currently closed until April 2017 for a renovation, and their menu might change too."

Took my family of 14 for a meal here and was looking forward to it however it is one of the most disappointing restaurant I have been in the last 2 years. I will start by saying that all and yes all the food was probably prepared by using prepacked paste.The starter Ngoh hiang tasted like it was just bought off a supermarket shelf fried and given to us 2/10 however the mushroom salad tasted good 7/10.Even the drinks were somewhat amateurish I had the cinnamon ginger and sipped only a tiny bit. The passion fruit drink was again too sweet. What a waste 4/10.The entrees were again so amateurish that we were flabbergasted how on Earth this restaurant is still running. The Rendang mutton was inedible in the sense that the soya/gluten was too chewy ( usually due to being too long on shelf). The rending tasted good but could have been much better 5/10. The Asam pedas was a total whacked job. It was but a thin soupy dish with egg plant dancing around the broth. It was so disgusting many of us had only one take. 1/10. We were left perplexed as to how they came to serve such lousy fare.We also had Sambal egg plant again it was at best mediocre and was not as appetizing as it looked. 3/10The next dish braised and fried mushroom was no better. Most took a piece and never had a second. 2/10We also had brown/red rice and everyone had a drink. For 14 we ordered 3 dishes of each.The total bill came to $680 including service charge.I must say the service was excellent 9/10 however the food left a very bad aftertaste. All did not want to order any desserts so we went off to lau pasak for Chen dollars etc etc.I do not have a habit of putting a restaurant down as many make a living out of it however in this case I took exception. The food was horrendously prepared cheaply and tasteless was not on par as what should be served in any restaurant.

Best to eat with something on the lighter side (like the tofu or scallops).Calamansi Juice: The juice wasn't that fresh as it was still a tad bitter but overall was fine.Steamed Jade Wrap: This was delicious! The filling and wrap had balanced flavors. The sauce stood out the most in this dish though.Mushroom ""Scallops"": This was my favorite of the dishes we ordered. The mushrooms were juicy and well-cooked. The texture of these mushrooms is amazing. Service is quick and attentive.

I love trying out different veg restaurants so that I can compare one to another and know what I prefer, etc. One thing I didn't like about this place was that they charge for water. Not bottled water, but just hot water. I thought that was extremely odd. I turned it down since I've never had to pay for hot water in my life at any restaurant I've ever been to, the fact that they charge for water just screams ""cheap"" to me."

Both are wonderful and already sweetened, but not too sweet. I've had their Tom yum soup, rand dang, olive rice and sweet & sour chicken. All wonderful! The portions are also just right, for me at least. I wouldn't say great for sharing since it may or may not be enough, depending on how many people are with you or how big your bellies are. Considering I can eat quite large portions all to myself, I usually order 2 dishes and I still end up with take away.

The memorable one is definitely the rendang and the oatmeal tofu.The rendang is made with mushrooms. The gravy is so rich and fragrant that you really do not miss the meat. The mushrooms used also has a great meaty texture and this is a perfect vegetarian rendang.The oatmeal tofu is a rendition of oatmeal prawns vegetarian style. Oatmeal is sweet and nicely crisped, and not oily. Brilliant deep frying.Price point, it is not cheap but not restaurant expensive like LingZhi. It's closer to bistro/cafe pricing.

He also has had the oatmeal tofu at some other point and said it was really good, didn't miss meat at all :)Thai mango and tamarind mango fish ($18) was also yummy, liked the sauce a lot! The 'fish' was more like five round slices of patties. Texture and taste were like a water chestnut/lotus root mix, not sure where the tofu came in really. The skin forming the circumference of the patty recalled the seaweed chip appetizer. Somewhat carby, actually, so was quite content to eat it without rice.The bf ordered brown rice (as opposed to white, said it wouldn't feel right ordering white rice at such a healthy place haha)."

I think if you're planning to come here earlier, it might be a good idea to make a reservation first just in case.Individual prices are a little pricey for lunch so we stuck to Tom Yum soup and 5-spice nyoh hiang to share. Then we each had Olive Brown Rice and Kampong Fried Rice. I'm personally particularly about my carb intake so seeing brown rice on the menu really did it for me.We were still looking through the menu when a waitress came up to us to inform us  that a group of 6 had just arrived and we should try to place our orders now to avoid a long wait. That was pretty nice of them really. So we placed our orders and not long after, our food arrived.The Tom Yum soup was delicious, though not as spicy as I like it. It's a pretty big bowl so there was more than enough for me and my friend to share. Next the nyoh hiang. SO GOOD! The sweet sauce that come with this complimented this perfectly. The pieces are smaller than they appear in the picture on the menu though but again, there was more than enough for both of to share.My Olive Brown Rice was really good I must say. I love olives in general so I didn't think they could go wrong on this with me. I was a bit surprised that it didn't have cashews though, but maybe it's only because my previous experiences with Olive Fried Rice always had cashews. Haha. Overall, I really enjoyed this dish!  Unfortunately though, the same can't be said for the Kampong Fried Rice. My friend complained that it was pretty mediocre, and after trying it for myself, I have to admit that it was the blandest dish among the others that we'd already ordered.Would definitely return here but probably only with a group of friends to share dishes with."

Nestled in a cosy but spacious corner in the heart of Tanjong Pagar, Whole Earth offers a range of Peranakan and Thai cuisine, from the highly recommended Penang Rendang ($18) to a mean Tom Yum soup ($9).Any true Peranakan place has a good serving of Buah Keluak, and Whole Earth is no different; its rendition of Nutty Buah Keluak ($18) will leave vegetarians satisfied with the unmistakeable taste of the dish, minus the meat. True to it's equally expensive but morally questionable roots, a bowl of Sharks Fin broth goes at $18; if you're looking for something soupy to go with your meal, however, the Homemade Assam Pedas ($18) is available at the same price but with far more flavour. Whole Earth's rice and noodles dishes are far less impressive, so it would be a wise choice to opt for more dishes to share while going easy on the mains. These steep prices do not deter the crowds, and it is best to make a reservation with Whole Earth if you intend to explore the scrumptious Peranakan-Thai cuisine, entirely vegetarian and almost addictive. You'll certainly be back for more, but, because of its prices, Whole Earth is more of a once-a-month treat than it is a regular place you can dine at."

Everything is subjective and all restaurants have bad days which is fine but I just can't justify going back to a place like this after the experience we had.The restaurant is out of the way inside of a budget hotel/hostel. After walking inside the hotel/hostel doors, you can make your way through the Wild Rocket entrance and into the small and intimate (and awesomely decorated) interior. Really good music playing too, we were pumped.My girlfriend and I came in for a later weekday evening dinner and ordered a la carte since none of the mains looked appealing in the four course menu (and the omakase wasn't available unless you book in advance since the head chef needs to be present to serve it).We ordered the following:1) Pomelo Salad with tiger prawns and frozen coconut dressing - Easy starter but the frozen coconut dressing (I think the waitress might have said blue cheese as well) was a bit too heavy. It was the only item that we did finish though.2) Salmon Belly Red Rice and Baby Octopus donburi - The red rice, although oily, was worth eating but the fish wasn't. It had a very fishy flavor like it wasn't cooked all the way.3) Laksa pesto linguini with king prawn - Who can resist a linguini dish that is made with ""Laksa Pesto""?? We were told that so many customers loved this dish so much that they constantly requested that the chef put it back on his menu. Unfortunately for both of us, the pasta tasted awful. It tasted like an overly peppered and dry pasta dish. Both myself and my girlfriend (born and raised Singaporean) couldn't even taste the slightest bit of laksa in the pasta. The king prawn was fantastic however. We ate that and left the entire pasta.4) Thai Basil Minced Pork Bee Tai Mak with Onsen egg - Just awful. The meat tasted like cheap ground beef that you can find in a fast food restaurant. Nothing here tasted good, we both took a bite and left the entire dish. 5) Teh Tarik panna cotta with pearls - It was a good effort but I wish they did something else instead of panna cotta. The pearls are identical to those you would find in a bubble tea (they give you four pearls) and the teh tarik tastes extremely sweet. I feel this was too easy a dessert to make without much creativity.6) Pineapple dark chocolate tart - This is pretty much what you can expect a pineapple dark chocolate tart to taste like. Nothing special at all.For a restaurant that has been around as long as this one and for the amount of patrons that have been here, I really would have thought there would have been more to it. If you want a real ""Modern"" Singaporean meal, I would highly suggest you visit Labyrinth instead."

The  food ranged from good with some technical errors to extremely good.  Each dish was presented with a clean and classic style.  While simple, the presentation was elegant.Complimentary Bread - The meal began with a nice warm focaccia bread served with olive oil and salt.  When we had finished the first plate, they were quick to ask and bring another  plate.tinyurl.com/ca529xtSoft shell chili crab with squid ink mantou - This was a tasty appetizer sized interpretation of the classic chili crab.tinyurl.com/cogpfrcBeef Carpaccio with sesame ginger puree - For me, this was a home-run.  The dish came with the ginger puree in the middle.  Our server explained that  the puree should be spread out across the carpaccio.  This was slightly easier said than done.  But, once I had achieved getting it spread around, it was so good.  The spread added such a refreshing element to the simple application of beef carpaccio.tinyurl.com/d5b5t9rLaksa Pesto Linguini - My friend ordered the laksa pasta.  The flavour was quite nice.  It was a very assertive flavour but I liked it and she seemed to also.  The server had also provided input that the dish was strongly flavoured.  However, the dish (specifically the pasta) was very dry and this definitely detracted from this entree.tinyurl.com/ck2nk4zRoasted Chilean Seabass with chai poh confit & congee - The fish was perfectly prepared.  It was delicate and flaky.  However, I would have preferred that it was served with something  that would provide a balance to the overall flavours.  The congee did not seem to compliment the seabass.  It competed and came close to overpowering the simple natural flavour of the fish.tinyurl.com/cnbtceuCrab Meat Whipped Potatoes - She ordered a side of crab-meat mashed potatoes.  For each of us, this was a new preparation.  In the end, I found it to be good but it didn't really standout from other whipped potatoes and the crab may have actually interfered with creating the best possible texture for the potatoes.tinyurl.com/c9geazkDark Lava Chocolate Gateau with flambé banana - For dessert, she ordered the chocolate lava cake.  This was pretty much a standard implementation of this dish that has recently become a staple. It was good but there wasn't anything to set it apart from other versions of the  same dish.  On the other-hand, you really can't go wrong with a cake filled with delicious melted chocolate.tinyurl.com/bn5nzjxWild Rocket Strawberry Cheesecake -  Maybe it is becoming a cliché to serve food in a martini glass.  But this was still a visually interesting and appealing dessert.  Following the server's instructions, I cut my spoon down and into the dessert insuring to get a little bit of everything.  I have to say, it was divine.  It was a great dessert incorporating multiple levels of sharp flavours, sweet flavours, and varying textures.tinyurl.com/cwexnmsReceipt ($292.40):tinyurl.com/bt9bz9cOverall - I thought Wild Rocket combined excellent service, a comfortable and slightly elegant space with relatively good food that included some true high-points.  From a culinary perspective, the execution was not perfect but did not greatly affect the  overall enjoyment of the meal.  I would definitely consider returning to Wild Rocket."

The menu reads so well and the staff were informed and able to describe and discuss dishes. The food I'm about 50/50. My girlfriend was worried she would have order envy but it turned out the other way around. Her red rice salmon and baby octopus starter was delicate, rich and delicious. My shitake consomme was deep, dark and earthy but the wonton itself was a let down. The wrapper was chewy and the filling bland. Her pasta was perfectly al dente in a deliciously dark sticky sauce. My chilli spanner crab linguini was so drenched in a quite sweet and not very chilli sauce that I didn't notice the pasta. Service was friendly and attentive."

Situated within Mount Emily, it was a comfortable setting to have a nice weekend lunch amidst the greenery surrounding the small boutique hotel it is located at.Being a fan of brown rice, I naturally veered towards the Salmon Carpaccio Brown Rice for my starter. For those who love asiatic flavours, you'll fall in love with this dish - the melt-in-your-mouth salmon coupled with the nutty aromatic brown rice and sesame seeds, mixed with chewy bits of octopus meat. This was an amazing mix of textures and flavours which makes you well and truly appreciate the beauty of well-prepared food.I also had the Chilean Seabass with Chai Poh confit. I loved the flakiness of the plush fish meat which was done plain to accompany to richer topping. The chai poh was not overpowering salty like how typical ones can be, showing how properly done food doesn't need too much seasoning to work. All these was served on a bed of plain congee which was a throwback to childhood food and really comforting to have.I rounded off my meal with something richer, the Strawberry Cheesecake. More like a deconstructed version of the cake, you get a creamy strawberry cheese icecream with a thick body layered with chunky bits of graham base."

The restaurant is nicely decorated and set in a dim, candle-lit space, and the waiters carry a chalkboard over when you sit to enthusiastically explain their special menu for the day, and the house wines... it's fun!Then the food comes - it's pricy (expect a main to be about $20-50 dollars), and tastes a little above average - the Pizza with Prosciutto and Rocket was pretty good, and the half Rosemary Chicken was just enough for one.

I wasn't impressed, and never went back.So when a friend said that dinner was at Wild Rocket, I was unenthused, and actually a little wary. Wild Rocket team, I apologise. You've gotten better. First off, the service was outstanding. I asked the waiter attending to our table if the once signature laksa pesto pasta was still available despite being not on the menu, and he was very candid in telling us that it's a love it or hate it dish. When we ended up passing, he brought out a  moderate sized portion anyway ""just for us to try"" (and of course didn't charge us for it). He was able to give recommendations easily, and most importantly, honestly! He told us to avoid certain dishes, and everything that he recommended was spot on.Well. We ignored him when it came to dessert and were glad we did, but more on that later.I confess to forgetting exactly what we had for starters and mains, but I do remember all of us being quite impressed, particularly with the mains. I believe my friend had the pork, and it was particularly memorable. The one let down that evening was the pasta main (not the pesto) that our other dining companion ordered. It was a bit flat, and really quite unspectacular. Desserts though, were an absolute treat. We had... hmm. A chendol I think? Of some sort, with delicious gula melaka, a ice jelly type thing, and a deconstructed apple pie I believe. Our waiter had actually recommended the molten chocolate cake over the ice jelly, but we were glad we ignored him. The other desserts were rich enough, and the ice jelly with lime granita... or was it a lemon sorbet, well with sour frozen thing proved to be an excellent contrast. We mainly ignored it though because really, once you've had a good molten chocolate cake, you've probably seen them all.So yes, I'm glad I went back to re-experience Wild Rocket. The food was creative, really quite delicious, and the service warm and accommodating. That's a winning combination."

It is actually a very straightforward menu that anyone could have made and I believe you can find similar menu of wet bakchor mee anywhere in every corner of Singapore. And how different and stand out you will find this stall is compared to others. This stall only serves 1 menu and 1 menu only: wet bakchor mee. First time is not dinner nor lunch time so it was only 10 minutes wait. Second visit was late dinner time at around 10 pm and we got to wait for 1 hour for our orders to come. And anytime, I would wait without complaints at all :) the texture of the noodles is perfect, with the right consistency and flavor that seeps into the noodles (I always appreciate flavorful noodles be it bakchor mee or ramen, that comes not from the soup or condiments but the noodles itself). The soup is very flavorful with its hints of fresh sauteed garlic. The minced pork is very very good since it is cooked in perfection, in boiled soup itself. The porkballs are a perfection with its tenderness and juiciness. Basically it is a bowl of heaven I am eating and I have not had any better bakchor mee than this in entire singapore (I am open for suggestions, but for now, this is the best, hands down). So if you have the time, you should eat here. If you don't have the time, come before or after rush hours and you will be delighted and come back."

Everyone else does it dry but this place has the power and authority to make it wet! It's the simple things that are the hardest to make, and honestly there are not many places that can compete with this kind of focus (only wet!) and quality. Let's start with the noodles. Noodle is springy yet not overly springy. There is a good bite-feel. Even if you do takeaways, don't worry that the noodle will become fat and soggy, the stall keeper will pack it separate with the soup. Thoughtful service. The soup is just so nice and you don't get tired of it. It's concocted in a traditional way of simply making good broth! It blends so well and so in-separately with the minced meat that were cooked with it. Meat balls are chewy and good, just tuck it in your mouth and I shouldn't have to review its meat balls to you!The last part is the chili. The part I never really cared about as I used to always eat it without the chili.

The noodles are different from the dry meepok version with pig's liver and minced meat. This is meat ball soup noodles at its most basic with only meat balls, minced meat and springy thin noodles. The minced meat is very different. It has a soft cottony texture that is slightly powdery. It simply disintegrates as you slurp it with your noodles. Definitely not the chewy minced pork at most stalls. The soup is a clear, savory pork broth which is simple but very comforting. There are several bak chor mee stalls at Bedok 85 Feng Shan Hawker centre but this is the one that you should be eating at. $2.50 for a small bowl which is alright if you have a small appetite or if you are ordering other dishes to share. A tip is to have this later at night when the soup has already absorbed the essence of the meat. Perfect supper dish."

Every whims and fancy would have been thought of and catered to so that one could go into vegetation and relax comfortably. The St. Regis provides all that customized service and attention with panache, as evidenced by accolades heaped on by many renowned publications around the world. The same standards apply to the restaurants as well and i was fortunate to experience what fine Cantonese dining means at the award winning Yan Ting. We had a special 7 course set designed to give us a preview of the 10 CNY set menus that Yan Ting has this Snake year. Think of this as a best of dishes list. Yu Sheng is a must have dish for CNY. Every component has its own significance and mostly related to wealth and luck. Yan Ting has switched the radish for snow pear to give the dish its subtle sweetness. I like that the sauce is lot less sweet than the usual Yu Sheng because pomelo juice is added. Abalone and Salmon are also included in this dish.Pun Choy is a classic CNY dish. This casserole pot dish came about when villagers offered the best ingredient they have in their home for sharing during the festive season in the old days. All the contributed ingredients would then be placed, layer upon layer, with the blandest ingredient (typically the vegetables) at the bottom and the meat on top. The end result would be a rich and flavorful stew that is delicious and satisfying.Yan Ting's Pun Choy is the luxe version with abalone, dried scallops, dace fish, pork belly, fish maw, prawns, roasted duck and soya sauce chicken, layered on a bed of white radish and cabbage. This is no doubt one of my favorite dishes of the night. You could also take this away for reunion dinner at home. Each takeaway order receives a complimentary Salmon ""Yu Sheng"" with Fish Roe, and Fried Glutinous Rice with Preserved Meat, all stellar dishes. This is a great leftover dish because the flavors are more intense overnight and the ingredients more tender. Definitely my favorite leftover CNY dish. :)The Steamed Sea Perch Fillet with Special Coral Sauce is minimally flavored to allow diners a clear taste of this premium ingredient. It's so premium that only top Chinese restaurants serve this fish. This deep sea fish is more expensive than cod fish and richer in omega 3 content. Definitely not something that you can get at the supermarket. The taste and texture of the sea perch is very delicate and doesn't taste as oily and heavy as cod. This is great for health conscious folks. More dishes in btn...Till that point in the dinner, I had been sampling all the dishes in an effort not to overeat. But when the Wok Fried Glutinous rice with Wind Dried Sausages was served, i finished every single grain. The dish is very simple but it tastes like home, very heart (and tummy) warming. I guess i tasted the effort Chef put into bringing in the special wind dried Chinese sausages from Hong Kong.The Set Lunch and Dinner Menus are priced $98 to $328++ per pax, with a minimum of 2 guests.

However, since then, it seems the standards have deteriorated and the dim sum has become pretty inconsistent... Based on my last visit there (last week), none of the dim sum was impressive at all. We got the... Har Kau, Steamed Vegetable Dumpling, Salted Egg Custard Pau, Char Siew Pastry, Spinach w 3 kinds egg (not on the menu but they can do it upon request), Chicken Feet, Deep Fried Eggplant w Pork Floss, Roasted Duck and the Siu Yuk (Roasted Pork Belly).The only thing that really stood out, out of all the dishes was the Siu Yuk, which they do very well (the skin perfectly roasted and crisp and the meat incredibly tender). But that was about the only good dish we had there, everything else was simply mediocre at best. Except for the Char Siew Pastry, which is usually my favorite but tasted bad this round - strangely enough, it actually tasted dough-y. On the bright side, I love the St Regis and the ambience of the restaurant is classy and upscale, obviously very gorgeously decorated. But with so much good dim sum in Singapore, I'm not sure how Yan Ting is going to stay in business (especially since they're priced so high - approx $5 for 3pcs of dim sum).In terms of hotel dim sum restaurants, I'd pick Hua Ting at Orchard Hotel over this.2 - 2.5 stars, mainly because I've experienced much better."

I really liked the cute dumplings with three areas, one with mushrooms, one with carrots and one with celery I think. The soy sauce chicken is really really good, tender and flavourful.

Here, Yan Ting has quite a few exceptionally good dim sum but some mediocre micro dishes; unlimited orders when you opt for a buffet-style. Instead of seeing a table-spread, this a la carte fashion allows you to order freely from the menu list - the a la minute way. Without repeating the dishes I have tired previously (the chef at work remains unchanged), I returned to savour 85% new ones, picked from 95 items, all vying for my attention!The orchestra start-off with ONE serving of Doubled-boiled Abalone Soup with Chicken (Braised Shark's Fin with Crab Roe previously - I guess you know why), full-bodied with clear seafood aroma but way too acrid for my likings. Rather, I preferred that Doubled-boiled Bamboo Pith Consommé with Shiitake Mushroom and Morel (bottom featured) - unclouded & subtle,  light broth with high quality fungi, very pleasant.Then you proceed to reward yourself with a portion of Lobster, the most celebrated chronicle was the Gratinated Cheese & Bacon - a sophisticated version baked using cheese that was smooth and rich and turned even more flavourful with the added bacon bits. The other Wok-baked in Superior broth & Spring Onion was paler but suits someone with a light palate.Highlighting the dim sum - Yan Ting seriously has the best BBQ Pork Char Siew Pastry in town. Consistent in taste except the changed in shape, the generous char siew fillings hit the spot every time. Others commented on the stingy stuffings and it makes me wonder if they desire a pail of it as I could see them almost piercing through the thin flaky pastry skin! The same in the past, never reduced in portion. I keep pictures of it if you wish proof lol. Less of any awful porky stench, the barbecue sauce coating the meat was gooey and sweet, together with the rich and melty pastry skin, I screamed for a second helping! They taste better than Shang Palace's, I confessed. But the latter has got a better Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ""Char Siew Bao"". Though both have a pillowy bun - soft and not palate sticking, Yan Ting's pork fillings lacked robustness and I'd prefer a dark chocolatey-hue, full of caramelised flavour from Shang Palace. Yan Ting's version wasn't that bad, it's just a personal choice.I didn't expect to reach anticlimax this soon, if you asked - skip the Stir-fried ""Cheong Fun"" Rice Rolls with XO Sauce. It sounds painful but the chef has declared the annulment of their marriage. The exceptionally good XO sauce has gone to waste when it failed to permeate the rice rolls, merely coating them - tasteless with a missing soul. Feedback delivered.My chemistry with rest of the dim sum was forceful if not weak. The weaker ones are the ovoid Deep Fried Yam Croquettes with Diced Chicken comes with a shattery outermost yam mash that envelopes some dull chicken mass - barely seasoned with a flat taste. The Har Kao & steamed Siew Mai have always been fresh and dewy in their constitution especially one nibble at the succulent shrimps in the pleated piece that offers a smooth and silky skin though I have never liked a Har Kao. Adequately seasoned, the thin yellow wrappers stuffed with fleshy minced pork/prawn mixture are topping themselves with crab roe, these Siew Mai make strong opponents.When the appetiser comes into picture, I have made a clear identification that the Soy Sauce Chicken topped my list. Images of plumpish chicken poaching in light soy sauce that perfumed the pot, excites me with immediate urge to bite into that tender, smooth bird fragments. Every bite comforts me with a lingering cinnamon, star anise cologne and tamed my excitement with a gentle rock sugar sweetness. The rest of the meat selections lost the race. Lacking the familiarity, the Roasted Duck requires that needing crisp in the skin but the meat is less fibrous -good. The pork has a louder taste in its meat; but the roasted version fared slightly better than its barbecued cousins, for its ultra crunchy blistered skin but too salty. If you want something to nibble on, the Deep-fried Whitebait makes good choice, while the pulpy Marinated Jellyfish lends a good chew with a strong scallion oil scent. Less impressive, the Beef Shank with Soy Sauce, not astonishingly tender and I thought the chicken & soy sauce still make a perfect couple.I had a deep swim in the sea, both the Deep-fried ""Live"" Soon Hock & Poached Cod Fish worth the attempt. Silky with loads of freshness in the meat. No fishy stench, only clean tasting in some clear light broth that didn't required much seasoning - simple & flavourful. Try Stir-Fried Scallops with Honey Beans - enjoyed a few tender & silken mollusks nested within some great crunchy pods with a stir of Chinese olives, its briny nature accentuate the sweetness in them."

In Asia and I want Asian food but every time I show my diet card, I'm told 'nothing for you here'. We found Shingthai near the top of Purvis St and I was glad we did. The menu says to check with staff over dietary requirements so I did, gave my order and was told that was ok. I had the spicy beef salad and the pineapple rice with pork and prawns. Both were stellar dishes. Lovely medium cooked slices of beef and they didn't stint on the beef either. The pineapple rice was fab too - beautifully flavoured with a great balance of sweet and savoury.I'll be honest and admit I didn't pay much attention to the decor and didn't use the toilets. Food came fairly quickly so once that was on the table, we all munched away. The meals come when ready so not starter then main style but that was fine for us.We were $40 sing for starter and main and a drink. Portions are pretty large per person and many dishes can be made to share too. Well worth a visit and as a gluten free person, a fab meal that was safe for me :-)"

Whilst the stuffed chicken wings seem to be the house's speciality, it was the red duck curry, fresh papaya salad, strip-steak salad that were my personal favourites. The strip-steak salad actually comprises excellently grilled steak, rather than the dry, chewy, beef you're often treated to in many Asian cuisines.The staff were very busy, as the restaurant is quite popular on a Saturday, but still managed to provide prompt service with a smile.The one thing I will warn of though, and this is by no means a negative, is that when a dish is typically served with chilli in Thailand, expect it to be close to as hot as the Thais like it.For my wife, this was a step too hot, but for me, I loved it.In Australia we're used to ""white person"" hot where the dishes have a mild kick and it was a (somewhat welcome) surprise to have some face-melting chilli in the mix. If you're sensitive to heat, ask them to tone it down a notch. I also assume this is why locals order more modest (aka bland) dishes and we were the only ones with interesting looking food on our plates.One last little trinket if you've made it this far: avoid the glutinous rice and durian. It's served like porridge and unless you really REALLY like durian (and that sort of rice + custard + fruit style) avoid it and order something else. It's not often I'm smiling at the end of a meal. I think this may be my favourite Singaporean meal, if not one of my favourites ever."

The restaurant had a very good ambiance and is very nicely decorated with many carvings on the wall. It was completely full as well so it was good that we managed a reservation. We started with some thai standards - the fish cake, thai papaya salad, Tom yum kung, pandan chicken and their famous stuffed chicken wings. Having eaten loads of thai food in the past, I have to say that the starters were good. I especially enjoyed the pandan chicken dish and the stuffed chicken wing. They had different dipping sauce with the different starters which allowed us to do a bit of mix and match. The stuffed chicken wing was unique - chicken meat stuffed back into the wing and fried. The pandan chicken was very well done and had a good sauce to accompany. The tom yum was also well done - clear broth with loads of lemongrass and packs a nice punch. We followed with a fried grouper, roast duck red curry and stif  fried Kang Kung. All very well done - the fried grouper came with a sweet spicy accent and the roast duck red curry was yummy & mildly spicy. All goes well with a bowl of rice. We ended with the tup tim krob and the mun chium. We love the tup tim krob but have been frequently disappointed - it was surprisingly good here. Itis a coconut broth filled with the 'red rubies' (pieces of chestnut soaked in some syrup n covered with a layer of red colouring) and slices of jackfruit & coconut. A lovely ending to a good night - Pricing is steep but we all had a good time."

The rendition of the Tom Yum Soup here is clear and tangy as compared to the red and creamy one that is served at other restaurants. The clear broth is very palatable but a tad too spicy. The fresh and succulent prawns in the soup make up for it though. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice too, which was delightfully fragrant and flavorsome. The pineapple, egg and prawns in the rice all contributed to the aroma, while the pork floss on top completed the dish.

Tom yum clear soup ($7 per bowl, I believe) - our friend said to order it clear if we didn't want too much spice, else it'd come with quite some amt of chilli oil and could be pretty spicy!3.

Rice cracker on its own tasted like one of those Want Want rice crackers, so that alone was pretty good. But when you spoon the dip on.. Mm! Comfort food!!5. Signature fried fish - indeed, as our foodie friend described, dry fried outside but still moist and flaky inside, with delicious mango sauce to go along!6. Green chicken curry - mm! my favourite. tender chicken, 7. Red beef curry - pretty good too, actually. Good textured beef, bamboo shoots, mm![both curries had these tiny ball-like pea eggplants in them, very cute! slightly bitter. also these larger rounder Thai eggplants which somewhat resemble tomatos on the inside]8. Thai fish cake - came with delicious plum sauce!9. Pandan chicken - very juicy and well grilled! Also came with dark soy sesame sauce of some sort10. Olive rice - SO GOOD. I hadn't had olive rice before, but this has converted me. I normally shun olives. There was some sort of waxed chicken or something that came with it, pretty interesting.. somewhat sweet.11. Seafood fried rice - can definitely taste the oil, but sinfully yummy. Quite a bit of seafood too! crab, prawn, squid, etc12. Stuffed chicken wing - our foodie friend said these are the BEST stuffed chicken wings he's ever had, and I have to agree. Bursting with flavour (again, very juicy chicken, mushroom, asparagus - which stuffed chicken wing has asparagus?!) and well fried!13. Mixed veges - normal oyster sauce veg, yay for lotus root. Quite a mix of veg but nothing spectacular, just standard veges. cauliflower; broccoli; asparagus; carrots; snow peas...I stole some of my bf's durian glutinous rice - it was somewhat surprising though, came in kind of a porridge type sauce. Not really what I expected - I thought the normal was durian on the side and glutinous rice, the way mango and sticky rice is served. Foodie friend's staple is red ruby, which I would've loved to try, but could not stuff another morsel down!"

I had been eating at the stall since I was young. I felt that the serving was getting smaller while price had increased too. The amount of fish meat in the serving had reduced a lot. It used to be chunky fish overflowing. I like that the yellow noodle did not have the ""Kee"" taste. The dish still tasted not bad.Best come during holiday when there is no office crowd.

The gravy is completely unique compared with what other Lor Mee stalls offer. Far more savoury and less starchy than its competitors', it is genuinely addictive, and I make sure to patronise this stall at least once every fortnight. Besides the thick broad noodles bathed in their signature gravy, you also get pieces of pork belly, fish, and fried prawn cakes. For all these you pay $2.50 (it used to be $2), talk about affordability!There's almost always a queue (because it really is that good), but no worries, the folks are very adept at whipping up bowl after bowl very quickly. Be sure to ask for extra vinegar and crushed garlic. Also, the stall is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays."

The pomfret was especially fresh and did not have that fishy flavor that you would find in fish that is not so fresh anymore. However, one thing that I disliked was that the service is not as friendly, probably because they were very busy with customers. No smiles, just quick and cursory service. But anyway, I was here for the food so I did not care too much about the service either.They also serve some simple yet delicious dishes, such as fried eggs with minced meat and long beans with belacan.

The skin here was somewhat inconsistent, and if you weren't very delicate and careful, it would break, letting the soup leak out. Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar."

Found this on Yelp and no regrets about trying it. I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung. My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it. Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal. It makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap can't be found easily in the US :( P.S I gotta try this Good Beer Company everyone's mentioning :p P.P.S.

But don't get me wrong, the meat filling isn't dry by any means. I find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin. For a little variety try them in different combination of sauces (soy or vinegar only, and mixed) and with/without ginger. Try with ketchup ... ok, just kidding.

Finally found the dumpling shop run by 2 cheery China guys.I started with an order of boiled dumplings. Once the others took a taste, they started really getting into it. We ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie.The xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it, I think it's Chinese wine. These and the pot stickers (guo tie) seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders. I prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as I find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying. The dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside. People were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes.I give 5 stars not because these are the best I've ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price.

This place does not disappoint. I had 10 steamed XLB which costed me $5.50 SGD ($3.82 USD). As I slurped each of the delicate and succulent XLBs, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the broth has a sweet umami flavor. The skin was tender but strong enough to keep all the fillings in without breaking when I picked up the XLBs with my chopsticks. Many reviewers have compared this place's dumpling to DTF - an unfair comparison given that DTF is a huge global franchise. In my opinion, this place is way better than DTF. I would not hesitate to come back again and again."

Nice broth and tasty. The stall is found in the southeast corner of the Chinatown Complex, which is behind the CK Dept. Store. Everything is made to order, so you do have to wait a few minutes."

I can't believe I found this place amongst all the food stands in Chinatown Complex! We went to Chinatown complex looking for the Good Beer Company but since it was dinner time thought it would be great to get some food too especially because we were in a gigantic food court.After walking around the food court for 10 mins, I found this little shop selling xiao long bao. The couple at the shop were hand making them as you order. They were selling them at 10 XLBs for 5.50 Singaporean dollars (incredible!) I ordered 10 to share with the hubby, we finish them in 2 mins and went back to get 20 more! They were delicious and much cheaper than restaurants like Din Tai Fung...etc.Totally recommend going there if traveling in Singapore!"

Excellent dumplings! Cheap! Only $4.50 for 10. The xiao long bao are great, but you HAVE to try the potstickers. They take a little longer to fry up, but definitely worth the wait. The spicy dumplings are a close second. The hawkers are really friendly and never turn anyone away when they are trying to close. (Although once the sign goes off you'll only get xiao long bao.) I've noticed that there are a lot more fellow ang moh in the queue with me lately. Probably no coincidence that so many reviews start with ""I was going to Good Beer Company and..."""

Don't waste your money anywhere else, especially not Din Tan Fung. They go down perfectly with some Good Beer Company beer :) and for 5$ for 10, how could you go wrong? Still unbelievable how they haven't changed their prices in two years and how you still only wait 5 minutes for 40 XLBs!"

I was on a mission to find this stall along with the Good Beer Company and it was a sucess.  I ordered 10 ""steamed mini buns"" for $5.50 and the uncle there was busy hand making them.  Mine were premade as they were not busy when I stopped by so they already had some waiting but they did taste very fresh.  I ate them both with and without the ginger vinegar dip and actually preferred them without the vinegar.  They were already very juicy!"
