or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our \"go to\" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality and this was one of those places that didn't have any such advertisements but the quality was definitely there.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the \"Wok Hei\" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours balanced very well and the Wok Hei was more prominent than most hawkers, it was beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.We also always order their Oluak aka Oyster Omelette which has a mix of just cooked oysters in a omelette with garlic and chives which is dipped in chilli sauce. Although I do enjoy the version of Oluak here, there is a place that does it with an extremely crispy finish, that's hard to go past. We never miss ordering it though, as I'm a sucker for a good Oluak and it goes great with the Kway Teow.It may take a little time to fine a seat at the Bedok Block 85 North complex where the food hall is situated but there is plenty to choose from whilst there and it's worth the wait. The chicken wings from the store next door are good, as is the two stalls around the corner that sit side by side to each other that serve Bak Chor Mee aka pork noodles. Just check out my other posts at Bedok Block 85 North for more information on the food available in the same complex.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and on this occasion there was plenty to wrap my mouth around and we will definitely be back.Cheers!Dave.","1":"50 minute wait. We got into the line at 12:22 and got our food at 10 minutes past one. If you have that kind of time this place worth the visit. We got two small bowls of Singaporean style ramen and we both enjoyed it a lot!The noodles, the broth, all the dressings were phenomenal. \u00a0The slow cooked egg was silky and creamy. Chirashi pork was delish! My boyfriend wants to come back here again after the rush hour, as you can see the line getting significantly shorter after 1:30pm. And they are open till 7:30Also since it was hard for me to find the food center I bookmarked Gayatri Restaurant, the place right outside of it, so it's easy to find it next time. The hawker center is two stories, and the Noodles are in the ground level.$7 SGD per small bowl of ramen. I think it's worth it.","2":"The noodles definitely achieve the shop's goal of serving \"gourmet noodles at hawker prices.\" The flavors in the dish are extremely fresh and the broth is very well-seasoned. 4 stars just because the service - while trying to operate most efficiently in a small space - can be a bit awkward, as you're prompted to state your order while still halfway down the line, at a point when you can't actually read the menu, so it's tough to decide any additions \/ modifications you may want to make to the order other than the size of the portion. Although the wait is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be - once I had located the stall, I maybe waited 20 mins in total between joining the line and receiving my food at 12:30pm, peak lunch hour.","3":"This Singaporean take on ramen is special. Each ingredient - the egg, beef, wonton, etc - is delicately and carefully prepared, and assembled into one delicious bowl. Queue nowhere near as bad as people here have suggested (30~ minutes at 1220 on a Thursday) for a (by hawker standards pricey) $9 bowl of ramen.","4":"I was intrigued when I heard that there's a Singapore-style Ramen. My friend, who lives there brought me here when I visited last July. For me, this Ramen tasted like your typical wonton noodles with a lot of add-ons. Aside from wontons, they added a runny egg, potato crisp covered prawn and char siu. I like how they thought about making this bowl of noodles in a typical hawker set-up. Overall, I would say it's worth a try!","5":"Yum yum yum! What a great way to take in the people watching experience that is Hawker Center by diving into this delicious experience. I love the take on the Ramen, this is more my style than the traditional Ramen so I can see why authentic Ramen lovers may not be as thrilled about this remix as others. The ingredients were so good and the experience in general made it one of my favorite places in Singapore!","6":"I will never look at ramen the same again...Singaporean style ramen, is how they describe this spot. It's located on the bottom floor of the Amoy hawker stand. I came right when they opened, because I knew there'd be a long line. Around lunch time, this place is packed with business people on their lunch break. They have three sizes and I went with the medium. Get the chili!! Once you get your bowl, mix it all up! Their cha-su is probably the best I've ever had!! Their HK style wontons were beyond amazing! Their crispy wrapped prawn was nice and crunchy! And their egg cooked to perfection! I've never anything so good and it's a must stop if you're in Singapore!!","7":"Singaporean-style ramen? Yes, please! Came to the Amoy Street Food Centre with a mission to eat at Noodle Story. It's on the first floor and has a really nice sign and exterior. And a long line of people waiting for food, which is a good sign. I waited like 20-25 minutes to order. There's just one thing, the noodles, but you can get small, medium, or large. And you can add on extra sides (like an extra egg or more HK style wontons). The lady behind me said that the larger sizes just come with more noodles. After I placed my order for a small bowl, the light for the sign went out. The lady behind me said that that meant they ran out of stuff! I had such good timing! The noodles were SO delicious! No broth. Noodles were amazing. The hard-boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The potato wrapped shrimp was super tasty. And the wontons and chashu pork were yummy! A perfect 10. My noodles also came with a soup. Totally worth the wait!!!","8":"Our last day in town and we got there around 2pm and they were sold out as we were in line. \u00a0The young owner explained that they ran out of a few toppings. \u00a0We said we didn't care and we would be happy if he can give us what he has left. \u00a0The noodle was fine but the chef owner was so kind that the experience was a good one. \u00a0We took pictures with the chef and got our noodle story as the last customer that day.","9":"Visited this shop approximately a month ago. Came with a high expectation amid the fanfare generated by the Michelin announcement, and the plethora of cool pictures on Instagram.Ordered the jumbo plate and it was.... okay. Many people loved its concept of a Singapore-style ramen, but it was fusion-confusion for me. Personally, I found it pretty weird to be eating a wanton (Chinese dish) immediately after a cha-shu (Japanese dish), In entirety, the taste profiles of the ingredients just did not blend elegantly enough. In addition, I found the noodles too cluttered in a lump, making it tough to eat. Finally, the chilli looked cool, but tasted pretty dry.Nonetheless, I was deeply impressed by the quality of the ingredients, and that the owners decided not to cut corners despite the price point and hawker-food positioning. The potato wrapped prawn was also pretty incredible - crunchy and tasty. And yes, the bowl of noodle was full of cool ingredients that would make it very much Instagram-worthy.Does it deserve a Bib Gourmand? Probably not for me, although the owners are still pretty young and will only go up from there. I applaud their audacity to sort of reinvent the wheel, and I look forward to trying their dish again in a year.","10":"My bowl of noodles was meticulously prepared, reminiscent of the care that goes into a bowl of Japanese ramen.It was certainly a step up in ingredient quality from the usual hawker fare.I do however agree with other reviewers that the dumplings and chashu lack an umami punch. My guess is that they don't use MSG, but unlike Japanese ramen shops, don't have enough ingredients that contribute their own umami.Of course, these are small grouses given the very reasonable price of $5.5-$7.5. It's certainly worth a try if you're near Amoy.","11":"I think that it may be wrong to come to this stall with the intention of tasting typical wanton mee. The stall owner describes this as a Singaporean style ramen. An apt description.Everything here is done as per ramen standards. The soup, the pork belly( imported from Spain and cooked sous vide for 36 hours) to the potato wrapped prawns and HK style wanton. Careful attention and detailed work. The result? A damn good bowl of wan ton mee. Don't expect the fiery chilli like eng's or the one at da Jie. But come here if you want a take on wanton mee by a new generation of chefs.","12":"Fight through the Hawker market to find a diamond in the lower class diamonds. Who are we kidding? Everything is delicious at these Hawker markets. But this place. Wow. Amazing 'Singaporean' noodles. Tiny place to make them and yet perfection each time. If you are in Singapore for one day, this is the place for lunch!","13":"It was pretty good but not amazing, somehow. Perhaps I was just missing the typical random stalks of veg that come with normal wanton mee.. Also I prefer normal char siew to the cha shu that they provided here (think layers of fat + meat, I really do not like fat in my meat).Anyway, $5 noodle bowl does come with a fair bit of stuff - yummy potato strip-wrapped prawn (deep fried and certainly crisp! nice texture); 3 slices cha shu; 3 pcs wonton (v bouncy w prawn inside); fried shallots; some seasoning or other which adds some sweetness to the sauce. Pretty gd sambal too! Mee is the wonton mee texture, probably my favourite type of noodles :)It does take a while to get your food though.. Oh, it also comes with a bowl of soup.","14":"Curry noodle. \u00a0One of the best in Singapore. \u00a0Micheline guide rated. \u00a0Honestly, what else can you say? \u00a0Savory broth, not too spicy for this American palate, tender juicy chicken, fishcake slices, bits of potato. \u00a0If you're new to this, I recommend getting the smallest bowl (which is still huge), and the yellow noodles.","15":"If you fancy a good bowl of curry chicken bee hoon mee, come here! \u00a0Located in Hong Lim \u00a0hawker center, this place is a MAZE! - it is as confusing as Mustaffa shopping center but just as amazing. Some of the food stalls here are listed in the Michelin guide Singapore and Ah Heng is one of them. \u00a0If you're here during lunch, be prepared to queue. The line can be long, but it does move quickly. The server \/ staffs manning the stall is professional enough to get your order and prepare your bowl of goodness under 10 mins. It's that impressive! I've tried other similar stalls in the CBD area and this one is less intense as compared to the others. The curry soup is not as thick and \"creamy\" (the way I like it) and once mixed with the aromatic chili served separately, hell will break loose... I mean, be prepared to sweat it out while indulging in a bowl of very delicious curry noodles. I ordered a large bowl ($5.50 if not mistaken) and the portion is just perfect. The noodles is topped with a generous portion of steamed chicken depending on the size you order. I am definitely coming back though it might take some time since there are so many food stalls to try and explore and before I know it, I might lose my way finding Ah \u00a0Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee stall again.","16":"Heng (Lucky) To Only Have Eaten It Once. I love my curry. Chicken curry, Fish Curry, Indian Curry, Chinese Curry, Japanese Curry, Nonya Curry.... You name it I love it and \u00a0curry chicken noodles are no exception. Curry Chicken Noodle is one of my great pleasures and certainly a comfort food. Whether it's a cold day, or after a hard day of work, nothing soothes the soul like a hot, rich, fragrant bowl of curry chicken noodles. I've heard of the 2 curry chicken noodles for the longest time but never got around to tying them. Either because we passed by when I wasn't hungry or the queues were way too long. One day, while deciding to have breakfast there, I noticed that there were only 4 people in the queue.Finally! My chance to try! As the one on the first floor was closed, I decided to try Ah Heng, the one that usually has the longer queue. Doubts started to set in once the bowl was served to me. The soup looked a bit light, obviously lacking the orange-ness that you normally find in curry noodles. There was a slight fragrance to it and well... I've learnt not to judge a book by its cover, especially for food. However, one taste of the soup and I was very sadly proven right. The soup didn't really taste like a curry chicken soup. It tasted more of a salty chicken soup with a hint of curry added, a bit like making a curry Instant noodle and realizing you added a little too much water. While the chicken was pretty tender, the lack of oomph in the curry ensured that the potatoes looked and tasted like well..... Salty boiled potatoes are there wasn't enough sweetness in soup to excite me while it was being soaked in the \"tau pok\".Sadly... I really don't see what all the fuss and long queue is about. In general, the entire dish tasted a lot like the one time I tried using canned chicken curry to make into curry chicken noodles. Similar to that incident, I will only try it once and never again.","17":"The chicken curry noodles here was very tasty. The chicken was very tender, and the yellow noodles had a nice chew to it. I would definitely eat it again if I had stayed in Singapore longer.","18":"This is my favourite place in singapore. If i can only have one meal here, i will come to ah heng. I normally take the $6 bowl which comes with chicken leg. Meat is so tender, soup is rich and tasty, and the potatoes melt in mouth. Yummy","19":"I find this stall slightly inconsistent. Today's chicken meat was a lil bit dry compared to previous visits!Everyone who frequents this Honglim Food Centre knows about the famous Curry Noodles! As the story goes, some people prefer the one upstairs and some the one downstairs. I personally have heard the delicious stories about the one downstairs first, only to realise that there's one just as famous on the second floor too!I've had the privilege to try BOTH within a short time span of a month and have delcared downstairs the winner by a hair.Frankly speaking, they aren't really that far off from each other and ure not gonna be REALLY missing out if u are one over the other. But consistency lies with the one downstairs and not Ah Heng due to their slightly drier meat I had today. Its not really paper dry, don't get me wrong. Just that if i'm being REALLY picky, then yep!! That being said, there so many other things in Honglim to try out there as well! If you wanna know follow this commandment, \"Thou shall Yelp search and Thou shall find out!\". ;)","20":"The current \"king\" of Singapore (Nik) introduced me to this and what a wonderful find it was. I am glad I tried it. I hardly eat curry chicken noodles because1. never a big fan of Chinese style chicken curry outside of home2. \"it is fattening\" being ingrained in the mind by the media and others3. those I tried before were lackluster and a total waste of the precious caloriesThis version totally blew the mind. I like the subtle smokiness of it and I believe it is from the chili on the side. Mix the chili into the noodles to get the maximum taste out of it. The chicken is very tender (white meat) and the taupok is thoroughly soaked with the gravy. The whole ensemble is just so good. Maybe I like spicy food but I do not think the gravy is particularly spicy. It is just nice to me.I will definitely be back for this in future. Thanks Nik, for the recommendation.","21":"Just spent a week in Slovenia and Croatia. Loved the mountains, lakes, history, food and drink. But there was one problem....NO CHILLI!!!!You can take the girl out of Singapore, but you can't take the Singaporean away from her stomach. Yes, even though I had the best of the Adriatic and the freshest yoghurt I've ever tasted in my life, I craved chilli. Chilil on my pizza, chilli in my soup...anything. So what's a girl to do the minute she gets home? Drag her dude to Hong Lim for some curry mee on a Sunday. Zero queue and maximum spicy.For some reason, the curry zhup was less thick than before and that was disappointing. It was still spicy (and yes, I tipped an entire giant dallop of sambal into my soup), but somehow lacked the kick that's ingrained in my memory. Fish cake slices are still large and decent portions of chicken and noodles for $5. Loved fishing out the well soaked tao pok slices too. To make up for that lack of kick, I had a bowl of home made fishball and fish cake soup (with lard of course) from a few stalls away. We're all good now.","22":"The curry chicken bee hoon mee here is served in 3 sizes. I opted for the smallest bowl of curry bee hoon. You can also choose from different types of noodles.First of all, let me say that the curry here is really more spicy than usual, so be prepared. The gravy is very slurp-worthy and is completely absorbed by the thinly sliced tau pok. There are also other ingredients, such as potato, chicken and fishcake. They don't skimp on the ingredients, which is a huge check mark in my book.The chicken was very tender and the noodles are very nice. Overall, definitely highly recommended from me.","23":"The Curry is very fragrant and spicy, for people who cannot really take spicy food, you might want to consider to have a drink to go with it.They are generous in portion and the chicken meat is tender. The chicken meat are de-boned and removes the hassle of using your hands or getting the curry smell on your hands. The gravy is good to the last drop and very rich in flavor.","24":"Ah Hock Fried Hokkien Noodles ??????? is the most popular Fried Hokkien Noodles stall in Chomp Chomp Food Centre. You are likely to see a plate of Ah Hock's Fried Hokkien Noodles on every table.We ordered a plate of Fried Hokkien Noodles $5. The Fried Hokkien Noodles is served in either $3, $4 or $5. Payment is made upon order and the food will be delivered to customers. After waiting for more than 40 minutes, our 'reward' arrived!There are many versions of Fried Hokkien Noodle in Singapore. Ah Hock's version of Fried Hokkien Noodles is- drier (not as wet. But there's still gravy at the bottom)- uses thin bee hoon instead of equal thickness of bee hoonTo my surprise, I quite like this plate of Fried Hokkien Noodle. Despite the fact that it was drier (compared to others) and uses noodles of different thickness. It was well-fried and richly flavoured. The mixture of yellow noodles and thin bee hoon had soaked up the essence of the broth and was just so delectable on its own. The pieces of squid and prawns hidden underneath the mixture of noodles and thin bee hoon were quite good too. The prawns were fresh while the slices of squids were well cooked; soft (not overcooked). Definitely worth the wait, it would have been perfect if it was fried with pork lard.Detailed review: foodiefc.blogspot.sg\/201\u0085","25":"This stall is probably very highly overrated. It is a far cry from its heydays in the 1970s when it was probably one of the best hokkien mee stalls in Singapore. I went back there today after more than 30 years to see if I could savour one of my favourite childhood dishes again. Sadly, I can only rate it slightly above average, certainly not worth waiting more than an hour for. Also quite disappointed that I could not try the cheng tng and satay bee hoon stalls. Wonder if they are still around after so many years.","26":"Of all the hawker food, hokkien mee is by far my favorite and what I miss the most when I am living overseas. (Ok, it is between this and bak chor mee)I like my hokkien mee moist, not too wet. The gravy has to taste of the sweetness of seafood and it has to be soaked into the noodles. And I like to have more bee hoon than yellow noodle.This hits all the spots. I mean all. This and Nam Sing at Old Airport Road are my fav.The only thing I am docking off is that there is always such a long wait. Even at midnight, we had to wait 20min for our plate of hokkien noodles. I guess when it comes to perfection like that, I just have to suck it up and wait.","27":"I really love Hokkien noodles, and i like my noodles slightly moist, but not entirely soaked in gravy. So this place of Hokkien noodles was almost perfect. Also, the seafood used for it was fresh and succulent. This is best paired with a glass of tasty sugar cane juice (which Chomp Chomp is famous for) - to wash the oil down.This award winning stall has throngs of people queueing for it, so it you want to get it quick, I suggest you go during off-peak hours.","28":"Unlike most fried hokkien mee stalls that use a mix of thick yellow noodles and thick rice vermicelli, Ah Hock substitutes the thick rice vermicelli with its thinner version. Personally, I'd prefer my hokkien mee with thicker noodles. The noodles are also a tad too dry for my liking.Having said that, the taste is still pretty flavorful. Especially after adding in a hint of lime juice. Waiting time can get pretty long and last around 30 mins.","29":"2nd time back and really enjoyed the food. Think Japanese, Korean, & Mexican. Put them all together and you get the unique flavors of Akira Back. We were a group of 10 and did not know how much to order so we asked the staff to plan a dinner for 10. \u00a0Next thing we know, food kept pouring out of the kitchen, from tacos to sashimi to rib eyes and sous vide chicken breast and finished off with signature rolls. It was way too much for us. I recommend, if you want to do what we did, to reduce the head count. So for a group of 10, I would plan for 7 or 8. That way there's room for desserts. Make sure to include the pork belly roll and you can skip the fried rice. I was too busy eating to take photos of these dishes. All of them are visually tasty too. Fantastic staff. Very nice and accommodating. Knowledgeable too.For a special night, I highly recommend Akira Back.","30":"Excellent appetizers, rolls and miso soups. Must try the spicy crab miso soup, the brother from another mother roll and tuna tacos.Didn't take pics as I was hungry, but will during next next visit.Staff is wonderful and friendly. Perfect for couples, groups, customers and friends...","31":"Have been waiting to write my review for this restaurant but was dismay to find this restaurant has not been listed back then. For good reasons if it helps in controlling the crowd for this restaurant (since I assume not that many people are aware of this place) because W O W, what a great great restaurant to dine and wine at on a chilled night. We were a group of 4 and started the night off with the mushroom pizza served with Ponzu Mayo and truffle oil. SO SO GOOD I could eat the whole damn pizza. Only had 2 pieces sadly. Continued with the Miso Black cod, Brother from another Mother maki roll and both the Wagyu and king crab fried rice. Each dish was tastefully done and had some great element about them. It's one of those dishes where you would think, wow I don't mind having a second portion of this because it is addictive. Located at JW Marriott , the restaurant's ambience was 5 stars worthy needless to say. I felt pampered throughout and would love to head back to the restaurant again just for a nice romantic date.","32":"Amazing sushi and great sake.....and the service was excellent. The restaurant is on the ground floor of the new JW Marriott South Beach in downtown Singapore....highly recommended....","33":"This is one of the prime hawker stands on the halal side of Tekka Market.Why do I say this?a) On the entire halal side, only two stands have long lines of patrons waiting to order at the place. One of them is Allauddin's.b) They have a giant set of clippings of prizes they have won from various local newspapers, magazines and other food raters. A few other places have prize clippings but Allauddin has far more than anybody else.So Singaporean food writers like this place.* * *Biryani (here spelled Briyani) is the order of the day.This is the best Biryani I have ever had - bar none.1) Most US or British Biryani is Indian fried rice. Colored rice with chunks of food.This stuff is drenched in a very very highly flavored curry sauce.So the fire blows out the top of your head on the first bite and stays that way.The sauce is great.The meat is great.I got fish, At first I thought there was a mix-up in the ordering because the fish was dark like mutton. One initial bite and four fish bones in my mouth convinced me that yes this was fish.But it was fish that was as dark and rich and tasty as mutton. This is a good thing.Side dishes were a spicy zucchini with a different fire sauce - and a potato curry with a third fire sauce. All three sauces were outstanding.The tamils were taking the three items dumping them all together and eating it as a combo.I kept the components separate on my plate. I would have been happy \u00a0either way.* * *Three last tips.a) Biryani comes with an optional hard boiled egg as a garnish. I recommend it to help stabilize the fire.b) The Tamils eat all this stuff with their hands. There are public sinks about five yards away from the stall. You wash your hands first, and then afterwards.Just as well that you know this because there ain't no napkins.Eating with your hands is optional. The Tamils were eating with their hands - dumping all the wet sauce all over the rice to boot - so their plate was maximally messy. Their right hands were soaked in sauce.The Americans and Aussies were eating with forks and spoons, doing our best to be tidy.The Chinese were a mixed bag. The well dressed ones with fancy leather briefcases were eating with forks and spoons. The ones in sandals and cheap clothing were eating with their hands. It is your call how you want to play this one.c) With all this fire - you are going to want a drink. Various vendors from the drink stands will come offering to bring you a drink. Take them up on it.All the drink stands (there are many) are essentially the same and charge the same amount for the same twenty or thirty drinks. Look at a menu for a drink stand - remember the name of a drink that sounds good to you - then order your food from Alauddin's and wait for a drink stand person to come around.You will be happy when he comes with the fire truck.And you will be VERY happy that you chose to set your mouth on fire at Alauddin's.","34":"While I am not a Biryani expert by any means, I get the concept. Rice + Meat + some type of gravy = comfort food in any culture. As I was downing this, it actually reminded me of my own reference point for exactly this type of comfort food: Loco Moco in Hawaii (a mound of steamed rice topped with a hamburger patty, dark gravy, and a runny egg). The effect on the eater is similar...total satiety. I sought this place out after seeing it on some internet recommendations and it did not disappoint. Located in the Tekka Center food court area, it is impressive to see that this stall has received many awards for its biryani. It was surrounded by throngs of apparent local experts as they all seemed to be able to eat with their hand while I was looking for cutlery. There also appear to be 2 stalls facing each other both with the same name. Apparently they are popular enough that 2 stalls helps to keep the size of the queue manageable at rush hour. The size of the pot that the rice and meat resides in was staggering and they are no slouches when it comes to portioning out your order. While the chicken and rice were fragrant and tender, it was the bowl of \"gravy\" that was the star of the show. I am calling it \"gravy\" because I am not really sure what the proper term for it is but it tasted of curry and was faintly fragrant of lamb which was quite nice. Spooning it over the rice made the entire plate come together. It also had some heat that snuck up on me after about 10 minutes. It was subtle and I did not notice it at first because the entire place felt like a sauna to begin with but about 10 minutes into eating it, I was pouring sweat off my forehead. One of the workers walking by actually asked me if I was ok which is now kind of comical thinking about it. He probably thought I was having the big one in the middle of the wet market! What was great about it was that I don't think I even noticed it because of the euphoria that seemed to accompany it. You know how you can get a pretty good endorphin release when eating something really spicy? That is exactly how this played out. I was feeling so good that I did not really even notice that my internal organs were spontaneously combusting. Damn that was a good plate of food for $5 SGD. If Indian food is your thing, I highly recommend seeking this place out.","35":"While strolling through Little India one day we decided to have lunch at the food court and find a random place to eat at. Well I was standing in line at a place for briyani and my husband was roaming for something to drink and discovered this place. I'm so glad he found this place. We shared a chicken briyani and some crackers. YUM the chicken was amazing!!! I couldn't stop eating it and stopped myself because my husband wasn't back from getting our drinks. He thought the chicken was really good too. It came with a side of curry and that good with lots of flavor. They have another stall right across that has other options for meals.","36":"I discovered this gem while on a hunt for the best briyani in Little India. It's located within Tekka market's food center. There's actually 2 stalls (located directly across each other), one for the briyani and 1 for everything else. Look out for the white sign boards! You'll see a lot of people eating with their hands here, but there's free plastic cutlery at the table in front of the store for those who'd rather not.For $4, you get a generous serving of briyani (saffron rice) and meat of your choice- fish or chicken. I'd go for the chicken! It was soft, tender and slipped easily off the bone (quite a feat considering that I was using flimsy plastic cutlery to do this). The fish came deboned so it was easy to eat, and was not too dry. It also comes with a small bowl of curry that was flavorful but not spectacular. Still, I had cravings for a week after trying this.Pair it with a teh halia for a truly satisfying meal!","37":"This is where you get the best briyani, hands down!This stall has been around for thirty years and recipes are passed down in the family. The meat falls from the bone at the slightest pressure of the fork. The rice is fragrant, spicy, but they don't score very well with presentation! Rice is scooped onto styrofoam plates, the meat of your choice is placed on top of it and covered with more rice. Achar is ladled onto the rice and a styrofoam bowl of curry is put onto the the plate. That's what customers are served.Instead of metal cutlery, plastic cutlery is provided. I didn't feel like dirtying my hands at one time, so I used those. \u00a0The strangers who were sharing the same table as us straight away said to me, \"Use your hands! Eating Indian food with cutlery is like making love to an interpreter\". Oh, okay. I was famished, so that comment didn't stop me from wolfing down my briyani.Told my Indian-Arab grandmum about the incident and she laughed out loud. Evidently, I haven't been properly schooled in Indian etiquette. Aiya, give me face, can? I spend more time with my Chinese grandmum, not her.","38":"Amazing taste for the foodie. Been here many times during my childhood days. Now back for a visit after many years and I found them again at the same spot. Taste is consistent and feels the same after all these years. Very crowded when I went the line moves fast. Eating with hands was so satisfying and you don't have to worry abt washing them as there are communal wash areas right beside the stall. Rice was soft and fragrant. Meat was tender. I had mutton and...mmm.mmm. will miss it for sure. I pray \u00a0they will be around when I come back next.","39":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have had many fond memories, special events. Since winning a Michelin star, their food continues to improve. In terms of variety, quality, creativity and presentation, Alma is in the same league as other great restaurants. What makes Alma stand out are it's flavors. Exec Chef Johari and his Chef de Cuisine Zaini, Singaporeans lend unique flavors to their dishes. Every bite is an adventure. Front of the house is helmed by long term Manager and Sommeller Saravana who makes sure the service is impeccable. Nothing is too difficult and if you need something special, they will move mountains to get it done. Price wise, it's in the upper end, but considering it's a Michelin star restaurant, frankly a bargain. If you don't want to burn a hole in your wallet, consider heading there for lunch. At under $40 per person for a 3 course meal, you can sample chef's artistry in the cheap, though I warn you that you will likely go for the full monte dinner 6 or 8 course menu at a later date. Highly recommended restaurant, they change their menu every 4 months or so, so you shouldn't be bored.","40":"So I booked Alma because 1) it's highly recommended as a 1 star michelin 2) ideal location on Orchard Rd and walking distance from the Marriott where we were staying and 3) duh - it's my name! ;)Upon first arrival we were a smidge concerned as we were the only people in the restaurant at 7:30pm. However, after a few minutes of being warmly welcomed by the staff my friend & I knew we had made a good decision. The food further cinched that notion as our meal was absolutely delicious. We did the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing, and every dish that came out was more delicious than the prior one. Two of the standout dishes for me were the crispy pork belly with mustard and kale (cooked perfectly crispy) and the chilled angel hair past with seaweed and lobster. \u00a0The wines were also perfectly suited for each dish and the pours were very generous, although admittedly the sommelier didn't always pour the paired wine when we got each dish - not a huge deal. The restaurant did fill up as the evening progressed yet we were happy to see the service remained very attentive even so. All in all, we were very impressed with Alma and both felt it may be under-rated as a one star. My friend & I have both been to many michelins restaurants and IMHO our experience was closer to a two at least. Definitely worth a visit folks! :)","41":"Definitely caught by surprise that I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant, which I was not at all expecting. I thought this would be more of an \"it\" scene type spot with more hype than substance like its next door neighbor...But I was definitely wrong...My date and I had an early reservation and were fortunately seated at one of the tables near the kitchen. I can understand one of the previous Yelper's frustration that the layout of the restaurant is weird and there are only 3 tables that have a view of the kitchen. Nevertheless, my date and I were hungry and were up to try out their full fledged omakase menu so we did and it was definitely one of the best One Star Michelins I've ever tried worldwide. I can't quite give you a course by course breakdown of what I had since each dish was so artfully created with flavors influenced from so many different cultures. I tasted a mix of Indian and French in one course, Thai and Persian in another, it was just beautiful. Even if I could describe what the courses were, they wouldn't do it justice since it is just so abstract. Service was excellent and we even had a nice bottle of Merlot from Slovenia which was a first for us.I highly recommend you check out Bacchanalia for lunch or dinner. Try to request an early seating so hopefully you will have a view of the kitchen.","42":"Bacchanalia has moved to their new location at Hong Kong Street from their previous location at The Masonic Club and they have definitely outdone themselves in terms of food, restaurant's interior and experience.Though they have a smaller space at Hong Kong Street, the team has done a job well done working around it. With an open concept kitchen (even with a dedicated space where they prepare the dessert), the restaurant is well designed and make one feels intimate; like they are dining with the chefs.The food were very innovative and of course, exquisite. To be honest, I am those who usually skipped on the bread basket, but I was seen asking for more this time. They served the bread with the first starter - Cheesy Polenta. At that moment when I took my first bite of it, I knew my taste buds were in for a treat (and so is my tummy) for the night. It was absolutely amazing. Another dish that left an impression that night is definitely the Carrots 4-Way. Like the bread basket, i'm not a fan of carrots but after having that dish it changed my perception of carrots. They were brilliantly done up and it tastes exceptional! The other dishes were delectable as well - Vegetable Stock Soup, Coconut Risotto, Hierloom Pineapple, etc...).Lastly, the staffs who worked there were friendly and helpful; making sure that everything is in order. Most importantly, they made us feel welcome.All in all, it was a very delightful experience for me. If you've not been, I'll advise to not just take my words for it and go experience it yourself.","43":"Another place that totally deserves the one michelin star. This was another business lunch (3 courses) with the wife. Its a small cute place and hard to miss if you're not paying attention. Great service and great food. Each course was very well explained by the chef or the server. Loved the food and the presentation. Highly recommended.","44":"We had a wonderful meal at Bacchanalia. The food is top notch, we enjoyed all the courses offered. The staff really made the evening special. They were attentive and friendly, without being pretentious. It is a small restaurant though, and can get crowded. Some of the seats are too close for comfort but they only have one seating per night, and seems to plan accordingly with seating arrangement. Will definitely be back.","45":"How literal can a dish get? Rojak, which means mixture in Bahasa Melayu, is a salad of sliced apples, cucumbers, turnips, fresh-from-the-grill deep-fried you tiao (fried dough fritters) and crispy tau pok (bean curd puffs), tossed in a stone bowl with that sweet-tangy-salty sauce (and chilli, if you like!) made with lotus flowers and cuttlefish, sprinkled with crushed peanuts and sugar to seal the deal. There are plenty places to get a good Rojak, but Hoover brings it to the next level with the best sauces and the crispest, freshest ingredients.","46":"My first Rojak - a mix of vegetables, dough and fruit chunks in a sweet peanut sauce. This was rich, delicious and a fantastic pair with the saltier duck rice next door. Be prepared for a wait (20~ minutes at 1pm on a Saturday.)","47":"Well, it's too bad the old man has retired. It's just not the same anymore. It's no longer the die die must eat rojak. Sigh!","48":"I like it for its liberal and generous dousing of sweet prawn paste sauce and crushed peanuts, making it a wet rojak. If you love the sauce, you will want to scoop up all the sauce and end the meal on a sweet note. It is that sweet.The assortment of fruits and veggies are in pretty big pieces, so it is quite easy to stab one with the stick provided and get a satisfying bite. I do prefer the fried dough stick (you tiao) to be crispier. The version is a bit soft here. But it is still good.You could also ask for chili to be on the side, if you are sharing with those who do not take spicy food. Personally I prefer the chili to be mixed in.You will not miss this stall, which faces the car park, and often has a line of people waiting to be served. Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 21\/28","49":"Not quite sure if it's really THE BEST ROJAK in Singapore, because I definitely prefer the one at Old Changi Airport Hawker Centre!Well, I guess they just taste different I guess. Hoover Rojak is more of 'sweet' and 'wet', while I prefer the you tiao and tau pok to be more toasted before it gets mixed in... so well, it's all about preferences!","50":"Rojak is usually best eaten fresh and on the spot, but the one my colleagues dabao for me was really good. I generally don't go to Whampoa Market to eat even though its very near my office because parking is a hassle so it's really thanks to my colleagues that I found a good rojak place they can help me dabao from.There's a very good flavour overall and there are more ingredients than most places and the chunks of fruit in it are thick wedges, not thin slices.","51":"If Chow Yun Fatt eats here, that's good enough for me. It's the best rojak because they do not stinge on using good ingredients. I like the prawn paste here because it is less salty compared to others, and the yu tiao is fresh and crunchy. You rarely find freshly sliced ginger flowers used for fragrance in rojak anymore. \u00a0 All this all together and you end up with rojak that has plenty of crunch, taste and flavour! One way to get all the yummy goodness is to use the beansprouts to soak and scoop up the last bits of sauce for the best satisfaction.","52":"There are time you step into a place with little, or no, expectations. \u00a0All I got was a message from my sister saying that I had to try this place. \u00a0They had \"French bak kut teh\". \u00a0But order in advance.So I went. \u00a0Service is very good and friendly. \u00a0The kind of service which is just right, not overbearing, but ever present. \u00a0Even for the mundane things, making sure glasses of tap water are topped up, everyone's got a fork, and a knife, and a plate. \u00a0Spot on. \u00a0Top notch.The chef comes out to greet everybody. \u00a0And comes to tell us what this French bak kut teh is all about. \u00a0Its obvious he's been in Singapore a while. \u00a0He tries to tell us what the real name of the dish is, but we have a hard time understanding. \u00a0Its actually a Germanic name, because this restaurant features food (and wines) from the Alsace region. \u00a0Its pork and veal ribs slow cooked in a Dutch oven with white wine, and its mm mm mm, oh so good. \u00a0The French, he tells us, usually eat it with \"moos tahd\", but just for us (and probably every other Singaporean that comes through his door) he has prepared a small plate of chilly padi and soya sauce, the proper dark type. \u00a0Like I say, he's probably lived here a while.Its good, very good. \u00a0I finish the whole bowl, and 3 more.Have I mentioned the tomahawk steak yet? We thought a 1.7kg piece between 8 adults and 1 voracious pre-teen, would be a bit of an over-kill. \u00a0But I guess its never a problem when its cooked to perfection. \u00a0After displaying the cooked product to us, it was taken back to the open kitchen for the sous chef to dissect into tiny tasty morsels. \u00a0Oh my, I'm still dreaming of it in my mouth even though its now 3 evening ago I had it.","53":"The waiters in the restaurants were quite friendly, even though at the end we decided that we just wanted a drink so we sat at the patio outside. The waiter outside however seemed quite impatient with us. My friend who visited from abroad for the first time actually asked me if the service in Singapore is sub-par after our waiter left. Regretted that I brought him here.","54":"Although I hear the actual restaurant is really good, I usually just sit outside on the patio have some cocktails or wine, and some bites. \u00a0It's a good little date place, and super close to my house, so there's that. ;) \u00a0The prices are decent, and I've had the sliders (both lamb and beef were really tasty) as well as fries, salads, and calamari. \u00a0All good. \u00a0Service is decent, and easy to get in and out. \u00a0Solid choice for a quick bite, or drink.","55":"Living in Singapore, I end up eating more chicken and pork than seafood or beef, and finally there was a night where I wanted to grab a steak but not necessarily pluck down $200 at Cut. \u00a0While Bar-Roque isn't a steak house, it does have some nice options at a reasonable price. \u00a0As we knew our main would be large, we opted for just a shared salad - grilled octopus. \u00a0While the octopus was ok, it was nowhere near the beauty we had Osteria Mozza, although the romesco sauce was a nice touch. \u00a0The piece de resistance was a platter of 3 types of beef - short rib, ribeye, and hanger steak. \u00a0They were all well-done, and I really appreciated the fact that the medium rare was in fact a true medium rare, as i've been finding that many places tend to overcook a bit here. \u00a0Having mini salads was also a nice touch. \u00a0So overall, I would say Bar-Roque delivered with a few minor exceptions. First, the rib eye was thin. \u00a0I mean I have seen many burgers that are thicker than the rib eye here. \u00a0But the fact they cooked it properly was amazing so kudos there. \u00a0Second, while blasamic-based dressing was ok, it might be nice to have an option like blue cheese. \u00a0Finally, the frites were so so. \u00a0Perhaps it is because I had the best frites at sb bistro earlier in the week, but the frites tasted like they were cooked in a less than fresh batch oil. \u00a0The place is fairly spacious so I would definitely go with a group, and the platters are a great way to take care of the table. \u00a0A nice option on Tanjong Pagar road!","56":"There are moments of excellence in this restaurant but they're left shallow by uneven food and mediocre service. For the prices, they should be a top-notch experience but it is not. Our appetizers were great, but the meat quality in the mains was just lousy, but very well cooked. The food runner seemed angry at us when our order came out incorrect. When you pay $50USD for a steak, you expect a pretty good experience. While they claim that the food is French, it's the same vaguely continental food you can get other places. The mashed potatoes were watery, the other sides were merely adequate. As a last insult, they only had table-side salt, not just shakers. They may think that freshly ground salt is a good idea, but it is not. We wouldn't need salt if you didn't underseasoned the food..and then when we try and salvage it, they add salt to the would (pun intended) by not having simple salt and pepper shakers.This exemplifies what is wrong with the restaurant. A handful of good ideas ruined by trying too hard to be fancy and elegant. It just comes off as clumsy.","57":"I celebrated my birthday at Bar-roque in January. I thought treating my family to some French food would be fun. Overall, the restaurant has an energetic vibe and the food is good, but on the pricey side. The owners seem to be gunning for a smart casual, chic restaurant but the average prices you're paying for mains ventures into fine dining territory.We tried the octopus salad and something I can't recall now for starters, before sharing the seafood and meat platters and a pasta for mains. I thought the charred ribeye was very well executed and the lamb chops were faultless, but the meat platter as a whole seemed to suffer from a rather one dimensional flavor profile. The seafood platter had some succulent prawns and a well cooked john dory, but the fish didn't blow my socks off (try Blu Kouzuna). The ravioli (or whatever you call those little pockets of goodness) was tasty and heavy on cream. I also wanted to order the rotisserie duck but was unaware that you need to order it 4 days in advance. In sum, the food was good but not excellent, much as I wanted it to be.Service was proficient, which I guess in Singapore is enough for one to breathe a sigh of relief. The waiter that took our orders was a little sassy, pointing out that we weren't in the know about having to pre-order the duck like another table did. The pacing of the food was ok at the start but soon lengthened into very long wait times between our mains, which none of my family members appreciated and so we ended the evening a little blah.","58":"Had our NYE dinner here and was well-pleased with our experience... Service is impeccable (Steered by a kiwi, I may be biased...) and the barman will make a cocktail to suit your tastes. The tartines are a must... I had major food envy when sampling my fellow diners plates. The fries are done to perfection (like an upper class KFC - which is a compliment in my book!). I shared the charcuterie board which was very French (expect terrines and all sorts of cold meat concoctions), the special which was Oxtail Ravioli and warrants the term \"amazeballs\" and their trademark apple pie which was rather delicious but wasn't warm enough for my liking unfortunately. I've already mentioned the fries, but the mashed potato and the mushrooms were also perfection in a side dish. Delicious aromas permeate the place although I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the d\u00e9cor... the massive painting of a cherub (I think that's the term for baby angel?) was a bit naff in my opinion, as was the glittery curtains. But the charming staff and appealing menu made up for a few glitches in interior design. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a decent European dining experience, although prepare to pay for it... We paid $260 per couple (albeit, 3 courses and some wine).","59":"My mum brought me to try out the Fish Head Bee Hoon at Balestier, which was preceded by a 10-minute long queue. (Worth noting that the other stalls had under three customers at a time)Beach Road Fish Head Bee Hoon @ Whampoa Makan Place is mended by two stall owners - a cook, and a lady who handles the orders and payment.At $3.50 (\u00a31.75) for a pretty big bowl, it's great value. There's nothing to pay for service nor eating area. Just grab your food and find a table. That's why I love eating in hawker centres.I'm no expert on Fish Head Bee Hoon, as it's not one of my usual hawker choices. However, after trying this one from Beach Road Fish Head Bee Hoon, it has become a favourite! I love the light, milky, fish stock soup, as well as the slippery, thick rice vermicelli. The meat from the fish's head is cooked to perfection, stiff enough to grasp with chopsticks, but not tough or rubbery, and it falls apart nicely when eaten. This particular stall is awesome, because there is a generous serving of sliced fish. It is infuriating when you get lots of noodle, soup and vegetable, but just two pieces of meat. There's another version in which the fish is fried in batter, which I'm eager to try - an excuse for another visit!","60":"in direct competition with the famed Tiong bahru Shui Kueh in the same food centre.The chai-po toppings on this is lighter in both flavor and color compared to the other store. The chai-po is also more finely chopped compared to the Tiong bahru one. However, the kueh is better. softer and lighter. So I guess it depends on what you like better. For me, toppings win. So Tiong bahru for me.4 for $1. 10 cents cheaper than the other store.","61":"i first suspect something did not lool to rigjt when the chwee kueh came in unusually bigger and costing 50 cent for one. \u00a0 seriously the topics just does not have enough shrimp and just not fragrant enough. \u00a0 the kueh itself just does have the texture. . So much trying to satisfy the craving.","62":"This continues to be one of the better-tasting chwee kueh stalls around. The texture of the chwee kueh is bouncy and sticky, not clumpy. The generous servings of chye-poh are certainly a huge plus point and a very good reason to return, especially when contrasted with other stalls that tend to be very stingy with the garnish. The chilli packs a punch, and complements the rest of the items well. Service is fast, yet never impersonal. There is rarely a queue even on weekday evenings. Note that opening hours are 5.30am to 10.30pm daily.","63":"'nuff said. In my world there are only two kinds of chwee kueh - the chwee kueh titans like Bedok or Tiong Bahru; and the rest. There's a. lot. of. oil. in the chye poh but that makes it goood. Not going to go into details about how it tastes...it's a dollar, go try it.","64":"This was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. The combination Japanese\/French food was incredible. The setting was beautiful and the service perfect.","65":"Unfortunately for restaurants like Beni, once you have a terrible experience whether it was an off day for the kitchen or whatever, it is difficult to justify ever going back. And for a Michelin Star, this was personally the worst food experience with any of them worldwide.The other Yelpers that reviewed Beni are definitely very credible so I truly believe that the restaurant just had an off night when I was there.Now I'd like to say that the sommelier and the service were both impeccable. The wine that was recommended was phenomenal and probably the best wine I've ever had. I was also very appreciative to the team for accommodating my date and I very last minute although I would highly recommend that if you are to dine here, ONLY do so if you are seated at the counter so you can enjoy watching your food artfully being prepared.However, when the food started to come out, we my date and I both were shocked at the blandness of the first few courses. Then one raw sweet shrimp course came that tasted spoiled, as much as I love sweet shrimp or live raw shrimp, I just couldn't eat this.Then was a course that was supposed to wow us - a very expensive tea that had strong umami and tasted like seaweed. That wasn't that cool.Then they brought out a very bland truffle puree type course. At this point I was about ready to pay the bill and walk out in frustration which was a first for me to do. Luckily they moved us to a better seating at the counter and the courses began to be only slightly better with a beef dish which had nothing special and a special expensive rare chocolate that had very little flavor.With the options in Singapore for both Michelin and not, I again just can't justify coming back here, but who knows. Maybe if someone else pays the bill, I'll come back :)","66":"Beni is quite the jewel located in Mandarin Gallery, but it would \u00a0be quite easy to miss as it is quite low key. \u00a0Inside, the layout is interesting with a chef's table (counter) plus a few tables and 3 small tables in another room, which we had all to ourselves for a recent lunch. \u00a0The Japanese-French fare is worthy of its 1 Michelin star and this is a great place to spend a leisurely lunch or dinner. \u00a0Lunch is a 7 course affair, and the courses are quite small and light so you don't feel too stuffed. \u00a0We started off with the Hata, which was some small diced sashimi of a grouper fish - a nice solid starter. \u00a0Next was a choice between Salmon confit or challans duck and the duck was definitely the better choice, served beautifully in a bowl with vegetables and chicken consomme. \u00a0The mushroom soup was served cold and had a truly deep taste which was amazing. \u00a0As for the entree, it was half of a small lobster and a small fish filet, and \u00a0both were seasoned and cooked perfectly. \u00a0Dessert was almost too pretty to eat, as the pears were topped by rose petals from Kanagawa prefecture. \u00a0A final course consisted of coffee or tea and some petit fours.Pricing is very reasonable at $88, and there is a wine pairing for $50 which is also well-worth it. \u00a0The pairings are very interesting, e.g. dessert was paired with a sake, and the sommelier definitely knows his stuff. \u00a0Service is solid throughout, and I really enjoyed the personal touches such as the head chef bringing out the entree, the pastry chef bringing out the dessert, etc. \u00a0Dinner is a pricier affair, but definitely check out the lunch option too, as it's a great experience.","67":"Always say yes to the hush-hush behind the dark curtained B\u00c9NI at Mandarin Gallery. You wouldn't be blamed for not knowing much about exclusive Japanese-French fine dining establishment by Chef Kenjiro 'Hatch' Hashida (also better known for his Hashida establishment). Well unless you're one of the privileged 15 pax who has snagged a seat around the open industrial bar. Then, you would be able to dine on the exquisite seasonal French omakase that also changes daily, depending on what is fresh. Expect the usual (or perhaps fanatical) dedication to excellence by the team of Japanese chefs led by Chef de Cuisine, Kenji Yamanaka. You'd see precisely plated dishes of specific temperature, served in particular ways. The result was impressive and truly enjoyable, which is expected considering the price tag you're paying. It's $127\/228 for a 5 course lunch, or $298 for a 7 course dinner (with more premium ingredients). But of course, indulge further with a tea, wine, or sake pairing. We started with the King of Green HIRO premium, a Gyokuro Japanese tea. I've never thought of green tea having that umami flavor until this one. After the first brew, olive oil and salt was added to the mix and we were told to eat it up. That was when the umami was enhanced and it tasted like seaweed. Next, the Miellefeuille de Crabe Royal au Nayet SHOGOIN. A Hokkaido red king crab layered with pickled Shogoin turnip (using rice vinegar), and a Shungiku sauce (made from Japanese spinach). The light refreshing flavor of the turnip was punctuated with a slightly strong vegetable sauce. That said, it was still balanced with the sweetness of the crab and briny caviar.The Gateau au Foie Gras was a generous and creamy 3 layered foie gras cake. The bottom layer of marinated foie gras was super smooth, the middle a Jonathan apple celeriac puree, and the top was the Johnathan Apple skin jelly. I liked how the foie gras was balanced with the refreshing and slightly tart Apple and it's a nice depart from the usual berry pairing.The Homard Bleu took the cake home with the rich crustacean cream coasted risotto with cep mushroom duxelles and plenty of shaved truffles. Of course, it was topped with impeccable pieces of succulent lobster and a salty Parmesan crisp for contrasting flavors and texture. The Kinmedai Origine mer du Japon paid homage to the Japanese roots with the lingering freshness of yuzu in the flavored white wine cream sauce, and also chunks of soft yuzu peel. By presenting the steamed red snapper with scallop mousse wrapped in butter lettuce, the typically one dimension textured fish dish was lifted with the juicy crunch and coolness of the vegetable. I cannot resist the exclusive A5 Ozaki Wagyu from Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan, a precious piece of tenderloin baked in a matcha salt crust to maintain its moisture. The meat was simply drizzled with a super umami Madeira wine sauce which was reminiscent of marmite. Chef made it rain with black truffle coullis for that added earthy perfume. Oh, and Beni's rendition of potato puree was the next best thing after Joel Robuchon, though I found it to be slightly starchy. Next, a simple Brie Cheese salad served on a heated glassware for that melty texture. Simple but gorgeous, and thoughtful. We were then presented with a pre-dessert of Murata strawberries, fragrant rose jelly, and milk granite, which was delicious but I found it too sweet as a palate cleanser. That said, it was a decent dessert on its own.Desserts kind of missed the mark at Beni. I wasn't a fan of the Chocolat Framboise as it was on the sweet and heavy end. The raspberry mousse in the chocolate sphere failed to give the dish a much needed tartness to balance the flavors. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the curdy panna cotta texture. Plus a surprise birthday cake of semifreddo (which was simply.. cream). Finally the last course, cafe ER mignardise. As full as I was, I continued popping these little desserts, which fared better than the actual desserts. A cloud like calamansi marshmallow finally gave me the acidity I needed to end the meal. Followed by a dense and nutty cherry financier (lovely), an average blueberry tart, and little morsels of caramel coated Rice Krispies. Great meal at BENI nonetheless, perhaps save the dessert space for Hashida Garo next door. The Japanese are really good at what they do, regardless of the cuisine. Try this definitely.","68":"I was very impressed with all their dishes and will definitely recommend this place. \u00a0Amazingly executed food and presentation and attentive staff will make your dining experience wonderful and let you focus on tasting the food and wine!!!! \u00a0Loved it!!!!!","69":"Fantastic Cleanliness Helpful friendly Service staff \u00a0and the highest quality products incorporated in all their products The cones are hand made and different fruit ice creams are very delicious!!!!!!!!The management and staff are outstanding","70":"Pretty good ice cream, but it was very expensive! Some interesting flavors, though I felt that most were very mild. About $5 per scoop, and the scoops are quite small!Lemongrass-Ginger: strongest flavor. Pretty good!Spiced Pear: Good. Vanilla Fig: The fig bits were good, but the flavor was mostly vanilla.White Chrysanthemum: very very mild flavor. The cocoa bits were very distracting and I don't think it meshed well with the very delicate flavor of white chrysanthemum.","71":"Pricey organic gelato matched with a crunchy cone rolled in-house.On a hot day, gelato is always very enticing. The colorful sign lured me in. I had two scoops; one pandan flavor and one spiced pear. The flavors were generally subtle, almost muted but definitely freshly made.There were other flavors such as strawberry, lychee and chrysanthemum. I also sampled the basil flavored gelato, but it tasted um, closer to soap so I passed. The unique thing is the fragrant, freshly rolled \"thyme cone\" that costs an extra $1. This store is located along East Coast Road next to the former Red House Bakery (Katong Bakery & Confectionery). The row is newly remodeled and part of the same bunch of buildings as the red house, and this particular gelato place is two months old. There are a number of ice cream parlors along the stretch but this store is one of the better ones.Overall, it's ok to check out the flavors at this place, but do expect to part with a few more dollars. It's S$4.70 for a single scoop, S$7.70 for a double scoop and $1 for the cone.","72":"Yummy ice cream, though a bit overpriced, even for Singapore. Good if you are feeling ice cream, but not necessary to go out of your way to visit","73":"Small place! Not so great service, flavors are great! Fresh waffle cones were super fresh and they were making them in right in front of us, it was cool to watch. Ice cream flavors were different and worked well on my palette! Loved the ambience, sadly not enough space to take pictures","74":"Found this little cute gem while I was strolling around Joo Chiat\/Katong area. It was a hot humid day and I was intrigued by the cute decor of this shop. I decided to check it out and tried all the flavors available before purchasing because I'm indecisive like that. I chose lemongrass ginger eventually as it's the one that stood out for my palate at that time and every time I go to the east area I'll make sure I get a cup of the same flavor. The gelato's texture is so smooth, not too sweet, so delicious, so natural and lives up to its tagline \"botanical\" so I'm impressed on that!!!! They also have special limited edition seasonal flavor occasionally. I'll keep coming back!","75":"Very vibrant and cozy little ice cream spot. Loved the interior decor and not to mention the flavours! The white chrysanthemum was the best in my opinion. Plus the cones are infused with thyme, really fragrant!","76":"Ice cream and gelato shops are abundant in Singapore, but BoP is very successful in differentiating itself from the rest by serving floral ice cream (for example chrysanthemum) and thyme infused cones at a competitive price point. The ice cream is top notch with no ice crystals or inconsistency found.","77":"Gotta try the white chrysanthemum with cacao bits and lychee raspberry. These 2 flavours make me really happy on a hot day!","78":"Perfectly balanced gelato flavors, and not too sweet. I got white chrysanthemum with cacao bits. This was wonderful, because the gentle herblike sweetness of the chrysanthemum balanced out the slight bitterness and chocolate aroma of the cacao bits. The other flavors that were available were pandan, spiced pear, mango, pistachio, hazelnut. Highly recommend it! For the quality of the ice cream, the price was definitely worth it!!","79":"one word.. WOW !! I am recalling this from couple of years back and still in my mind this is fresh!! I was in Singapore for 3 weeks and was looking for a good Dum Biryani.. Found this place on yelp and wanted to try it...Went all the way looking for it and must say when i saw it from the outside I was very skeptical.. This is what one says that dont judge a book by its cover..The biryani was amazing!! Hands down the best i have had in Singapore. Given the fact that I was not sure till i tasted it.. made the experience even better.. The rice was full of flavor and the mutton was so flavorful. I has few bones to suck on and that was amazing.. I read one reviewer mentioning that if you get from the bottom of the pan then you are lucky, and I guess i did get that as the flavor was \u00a0so good.. \u00a0 Can wait to get to Singapore again !!!","80":"For a self service place saving money on a waitress this place is way way way overpriced and the food is very average.I had the signature dish, chicken biryani, it was average at best.I won't go back","81":"It's all about the mutton soup and the kulfi here. And if you get biryani, get the mutton one. The chicken can be very hit or miss, and mine came out quite dry while some of the others had chicken that was more moist. Sometimes the biryani will come in a neatly packed dome shape, and other times it'll come a bit disheveled and shoved in front of your face. All up to your luck and their mood I guess.Don't expect much in the way of service here. It's pretty low-maintenance. You have to call over the waitstaff pretty insistently for anyone to come and help or serve you. Kulfi is a really interesting indian ice cream that's not too commonly found in Singapore. It's simply ice cream with some spices\/pistachios in a little plastic cup. You have to rub it in between your palms to get the popsicle out. The ice cream also has various spices and pistachios sprinkled in it. Quite simple, but also quite comforting and refreshing; a great way to end the meal.","82":"Extremely overrated restaurant. Don't know what Michelin was thinking, while making this is a Michelin recommended restaurant. I came with my friend while traveling to Singapore and of all the biriyanis I had I was highly disappointed. However there mango lassi is good.Also sanitation extremely unwelcoming and dirty.Had : double kid goat biriyani, chicken biriyani, Haleem , chicken chapli kebab and mango lassi.","83":"Anthony Bourdain was wrong, the Biryani was just so so. I would rather recommend Biryani at the Tekka market food court. The workers were friendly but they did not make you feel welcomed as they were all busy with their cell phones. What happens to the mamak people used to rule the Biryani world?","84":"This place is all hype. Food : 6\/10, I got the baby goat biryani. I've had better for cheaper. The white sauce on the side was watery. The meat itself was tender and tasty. The rice felt old. Service: 1\/10, I felt pretty unwelcome honestly, like it was a burden for me to show up for lunch. Was not handed a menu, offered a drink, or asked how I thought the food was. Fuck that grumpy old man. Price: 2\/10, rip off. This guy is still riding the \"Bourdain visit\" train. And I fell for it. Ambiance : 2\/10- the place is dirty and gross. I should have just walked out and tried some place else but that thought of \"if Anthony Bourdain liked it...\" Kept creeping back in my head. Avoid this place, trust me. You're not missing anything. I regret wasting a space in my stomach and money \u00a0from my wallet on this place.","85":"Came here about 8pm on a weekday night, to grab takeaway of mutton briyani. I would not recommend eating in as it can get pretty hot, and the fans within don't do very much.Mutton briyani, $15 - worth it?The style of the briyani is the dry kind, with the mutton cooked within the rice, and some raita is provided. The rice is well-spiced, spicy, aromatic, but can be slightly mushy in some parts from meat juice, and for $15, there was sufficient meat within, and not too much bone. Meat is tender and comes apart easily. I am just unsure if it is worth the $15 price tag. I'll return if I happen to walk past.","86":"I've been going here for months. It is hands down the best dum biryani in Singapore. If you don't think so, then you need to read about what dum biryani really is. A lot of people recommend the biryani at Sankranti, and, while it's a decent biryani it's not a dum biryani. The meat here is tender and the rice fluffy. They cook the rice in two batches fresh everyday, so come early to have the freshest pick. Don't expect a restaurant with amazing service, this is a no frills place where emphasis is put on the food. Biryanis are priced appropriately. If you're going to eat a fish or a vegetarian biryani then don't bother.","87":"Overrated on many blogs, but reviews here are generally accurate. Average food, not a great place for a meal. Skip it.","88":"The decor makes it feel like a construction site canteen,there's usually a queue,you won't be greeted nicely (if at all),if you get served, someone has just done you a favor.The whole place is as auhentic as it gets, and it serves what is undoubtedly the best briyani in Singapore. (To qualify this, I'm a North Indian)The flavor (like the ambiance) is authentic, the meat (lamb & chicken) is very tender.Skip the raita (watery yoghurt accompaniment)I'd recommend you SMS a pre-order for take-away\/pick-up.","89":"Was a bit hesitant due to all the Bourdain hype and even more so after seeing all the reviews from Singaporeans about how it's not all it's cracked up to be. However, after trying the chicken biryani, I have concluded that the bad reviews are coming from Singaporeans that are used to their own version of briyani(which has its own separate appeal), that's covered in curry\/gravy. This type of biryani is completely different. No need for the sauce, all the flavor has been soaked into the perfectly cooked rice. The server wasn't there to please, but when the meal came so quickly, I didn't mind at all especially after my expectations for the meal were exceeded. I'd probably give a 4\/5, but I think some people harshly give 2 or 3 stars for arbitrary reasons that have to do with things other than the quality of the food, like their ego. 5\/5.","90":"Coming from the US, I have been pretty disappointed with the typical dum biryani found commonly here in Singapore. This place, however, has the best biryani I've ever had hands down, let alone in Singapore. Both the chicken and goat biryani were delicious. The rice and meats were fresh, moist, and flavorful.The place itself is pretty run down (and not in a charming way) and the service is mediocre, but who cares when the biryani is this good!","91":"Really flavorful biryani. The signs on the wall boast that they don't serve sauce with their biryani and you really don't need it! We ordered the chicken biryani, the chicken was tender and had a nice little kick. The only complaint is that it had whole cloves in the rice, which added to the flavor but we're difficult to avoid when chowing down (however I will chock this up to my American tendencies). We also ordered the mutton kebab which was juicy and delicious - totally melt in your mouth. Pretty spicy, but cooled down really nicely with the green sauce provided.","92":"I agree with Sean B. It's all hype. I've had better biriyani for cheaper. The rice was half cooked & the sauce was watery. Don't expect any customer service cause you ain't gonna get any. Moreover they make you feel like they are doing you a favor. Food quality : 5\/10Customer Service: 1\/10Overpriced: hell yes","93":"Over-rated. And very bad attitude of the owner. He was upset that he got mentioned in the Michelin guide as now he will have to serve more customers. It was shocking to hear that from a business owner. Their Biriyani and shaami kebabs are at best, ordinary. Don't know how they got mentioned in the Michelin guide. Similar sentiments have been expressed by my colleague. In fact, try the Biriyani at Sankranti on syed alwi road. It's much better.","94":"Followed Anthony Bourdain's review of the famous dum biriyani in Singapoe. The place could easily be missed as its a very small small shop on Dunlop Road. We had Chicken Dum Biriyani and Mutton Dum biriyani. Both were very delicious and fulfilling bit spicy but that's ok :). As it was a weekday evening there wasn't much crowd and hence the staffs were quite accommodating and friendly.","95":"Very average. 31 dollars for a Mutton briyani and one chicken briyani. With 3 drinks. Went with a Friend based on reviews from others nothing special and very expensive for what it is. Have had much better food at nearly every hawker center in Singapore.","96":"Nice hole in the wall as expected. The biryani is a typical Persian dry version and was exceptional. What was troubling was the price, $15 for a plate of mutton biryani, was surely very expensive, and the mutton was not as good as the chicken. The little pot of yoghurt they give, is just abysmal and watery. The guys serving and taking orders have oodles of attitude which makes the place quite unfriendly to go to. I didn't find the Biryani, attitude and portions worth going again. I am still on the hunt for the best briyani.","97":"The place doesn't look so hot - the shophouse is a bit rundown. But the dum briyani is the bomb. The rice is fluffy, aromatic from the spices and entirely greaseless because the owner cooks with safflower oil rather than ghee. Happy me cos then I can down the whole plate without feeling like I swallowed a rock but carbo-phobic eaters might wanna avoid this place cos like all briyani places they're generous with the rice. The chicken is tender and fall off the bone.But what the aficionados go for is the mutton and kid goat briyani. The latter is only available on certain days but the portion of meat is super generous for $15. I'm scared of gamey meat, but my foodie friends swear by the mutton and kid goat, so next time I shall drag them along and pinch some off of them to try.The lassi is fabulous - rich and creamy, and not sweetened to tooth aching levels. I'd advise going early cos when we went at noon place was full and a queue was already forming. And the owner said forget it during fasting month cos the queue starts at 5.30am which is when he starts cooking the briyani!","98":"I've taken a lot of my friends here and am extremely fond of this place. For 8.50 SGD a plate for the Chicken Biryani & 9 SGD a plate for the Mutton Biryani, is a steal for the generous quantity that is served!Most importantly, the Biryani that is served here is of truly excellent quality albeit the taste can be a tad bit inconsistent at times. Sometimes the rice feels powdery & a bit dry but that was probably because of the weather. The key to a great Biryani is that the meat & rice needs to be slow cooked in traditional spices for it to be at it's juiciest best. That is exactly how the owner approaches this complicated & subtle dish.This is as authentic as it gets & it's NOT that brown goop they serve with yellow rice at most places which even the owner at Bismillah agrees is an abomination! Biryani was the dish of Mughal emperors & soldiers & signified feasting in a royal manner. It was considered a complete meal in itself & it is with that respect for tradition & flavour that the owner\/chef Arif bhai cooks it. It is his love for crafting this complex dish that adds to the old school charm of this place in addition to the brilliant food. Try chatting up with the owner if you visit the next time, he's a wonderful gent with a well informed viewpoint on food & life...& throbbing passion for what he does.","99":"Still weary from our flight the night before we tracked this place down because of \"The Layover\" and you know what?It was damn good.Our first proper meal in Singapore did not let us down, thanks Anthony B. (I wonder if you have a secret Yelp account?)Anyways...A Lamb Biryani with a Mango Lassi on the side and I was in heaven. Perfectly floral and fragrant and slightly spicy to my Canadian tongue. It was exactly what I needed to get going.I had been to Little India 6 years before and vividly recalled the smells and colours that slapped me across the face on my own 5 hour Layover. What a gem. Once again you did not disappoint!Someday I'm gonna have to go to Big India though.","100":"No idea why this place can even be ranked above a 2. \u00a0Soggy rice. \u00a0Mutton is ok. \u00a0One side diluted white sauce no clue what that is. \u00a0Had lime juice that taste more like plum juice. \u00a0Horrible. \u00a0For those that give this place above a 2, i dare you to try Ali Nachia Briyani Dam and rework your review :).","101":"Probably one of the best biryanis in little india....if you go at the right time. The ambience and look of the place is not the classiest for sure. In fact it looks slightly run down and you might have questions about the hygiene levels of this place. However no doubt, this biryani, both chicken and lamb are pretty solid. There's a trick to this though. You need to go at a certain time, which changes on a daily basis and can be luck oriented....it's when you get the scoop of the biryani that takes in the most amount of the masala that you enjoy this biryani in it's peak form. I recommend 330 - 4 pm for an afternoon biryani","102":"Quick stop here to try the chicken biryani. I had never had it before and it was ok, I can't really compare it to much else. I guess I expected a different taste? I can imagine finding better versions in this enormous city though. I was a little star struck by the owner, regardless. Also it was a gigantic portion so three of us split one and tried the lime juice and mango lassi as well.","103":"Food was decent , nothing special. Don't expect customer service, not designed for patrons to fine In.","104":"Bismillah has been heralded by some food bloggers to be the 'best biryani'. It certainly is one of the contenders for \"one of the better biryanis in Singapore\" but it isn't the best.Many of the biryanis we would be used to here would be the southern kinds. Bismillah is different, serving a very northern style of biryani (and even then not quite a Lucknowi biryani... they're Pakistani). It's decent and it will fill you up, but I wouldn't say it was superb.","105":"Having eaten the gold standard Indian biryani from Hyderabad, my food snob radar was on high alert while trying this place. I have to say that the radar stayed silent throughout the meal. The biryani was very good - by far the best I have had in Singapore. It was cooked in the Pakistani\/North Indian style, and packed a solid punch of flavor, grease and meat. Would go down really well with an ice cold beer.Before I forget, the mutton biryani has a clear edge over the chicken version.","106":"I know very little about biriyani (what we get in the US isn't that great), but I thought the mutton version here was awesome. A bit expensive for Singapore standards, but hard to complain given how good it was. Well spiced, super flavorful rice, and super tender mutton.","107":"Yes the place is dark, dinghy, and on a crowded alley - but I came there for the food. Great dum biryani - doesn't matter chicken or mutton. The boiled egg inside was definitely a +.","108":"I agree they offer very good Biryani. However, every meal and product has a right price. I will give five stars for mutton biryani. This is one of many casual restaurants and nothing was special. I am not in favor to pay $15 for one plate of biryani.","109":"Phenomenal from beginning to end. The flavors of most of the dishes were just beautiful and unique, the feel of the restaurant being as if I eating inside the kitchen of a huge restaurant, and the service was kind and generous. Highly recommend.I was caught off guard by this experience as I recently lost much of my intrigue with Michelin Stars in Singapore but found this one to be spot on.Reservations for weekday seatings were very easy via their website which I believe uses Quandoo. We simply made a 7:30 res and took an Uber to the restaurant where we walked into a giant kitchen with only 6-8 tables in the entire dining room. At the time there was only one other seated party of 2, later there was a party of 4.My friend and I ordered the following:1) Pasta with Razor clams - This one is a MUST. WOW.2) Pasta with Uni or Crab - Pass on this one. Get the razor clam one3) Pasta with Barnacles - Unfortunately I misunderstood the waitress. Thought she said the barnacles are prepared by itself, not with another course of pasta. The barnacles were very good but I would suggest you not get it with pasta if you already ordered the razor clams.4) Roasted Pigeon - Best pigeon I've had, not gamey at all. 5) Wild Snapper - Excellent6) Strawberry Cheesecake - Fluffy, light, pink, Instagram worthy7) Their signature dessert (Starts with a G) - Very rich. Nice flavor but the sweetness is a bit much after the first bite.They also provided us a special Italian bread that they fly in every week from Italy.The chef is actually there and serves us himself many of the dishes. I love restaurants like this, very personal. Because the kitchen is right in front of you and in a sense, invades your space, you feel like you are watching a TV show with your food being prepared. It's awesome.The Boat Quay location is wonderful as well but can be hard to find. Keep an eye out for the signage and your Google Maps.Only negative at the moment is the quality of their cocktails if you do visit their rooftop bar. I ordered the bramble which was horribly sweet for a simple bramble (although the blackberry ice sphere was cool). My friend got one of the Sours which tasted awful. We barely drank them and left, hopefully it was a one time thing.","110":"Wonderful, sit on the top floor for the view (I think it's a bar but you can eat there). Both lunch and dinner are great. Staff and chef were friendly and attentive. Food was fun. Especially liked the pigeon and desert (forgot what it was called) the last time I was there.","111":"We went for the Menu Gourmand - the composition of which varies as you indicate to the chef which dish(es) from the \u00e0 la carte menu you may wish to have. The food is among the most refined and subtle Italians you'll find in Singapore. However, what makes Braci truly unique is, because the restaurant is so small, you can engage in conversations with the staff, and especially with the talented and enthusiastic polyglot chef Beppe De Vito, a real artist. If Braci were larger (and demonstrate it could achieve the same quality with scale), it would have two Michelin stars, not one. That said, although the dishes are innovative, beautifully plated and refined, the nearby Osteria Art (also owned by chef Beppe) serves more hearty Italian meals (especially the pastas, which are the best in Singapore!) Incidentally, very good wine list, with many 'reasonably-priced' Brunello's and Barolo's.","112":"My go-to Brunch Place in Singapore.I love the food and ambience here and being tucked away near the CBD means there are no crazy queues during brunch time. Hate to share the secret with everyone but this place deserves high mentions. In particular the brunch bread basket (2 chocolate pains, 2 warm croissants and 1 freshly baked baguette) with a side of 3 jams and french butter is my absolute favorite. The hot items are consistently consistent and delicious but i end up getting the omelette each time due to me being vegetarian. I also love the A la Folie mocktail that one of the owners make. Its some strawberry, mint, basil, sprite concoction that is amazing!I've brought a number of folks over to the restaurant and they've all loved the place. Havent had a chance to go during non-brunch hours but the menu looks very meat centric so I may give it a pass. I'll be back continuously for brunch though.","113":"Nice, classic French brasserie. We had the hanger steak, lamb, and escargot. The meat was pretty standard fare, but the escargot were quite special, served in shell and with generous helpings of pesto.Seems like a lot of the customers were regulars, a lot of families with kids in tow. Very friendly service, servers knew most of the regulars by name.My only quibble would be the wine list - good selection, but quite overpriced.","114":"I've been a little sick of fusion food so I wanted a place with traditional French food - no surprises lurking around my plate for me!I had the escargot to start, and I felt it didn't have enough garlic in it. Tasted more like a green pesto with heaps of parsley spooned on top of escargot. Don't touch the metal plate they're served on - it's HOT! I burned myself while shifting the plate.Next up was scallops on a bed of asparagus in a cream sauce for my main. My four scallops were seared BEAUTIFULLY. I could find no fault with the dish. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes, and yes, they were flawless too.My friend had the lamb, and while they didn't ask him how he wanted it done, it came sliced and was done rare. Beautiful way to treat a great piece of meat (I'm not being sarcastic). I love lamb done rare, but if you don't, be sure to mention it!Dessert for me was the Cr\u00eape Suzette, which they lit up in front of me, with blue fire dancing on my plate. I wish they'd put more alcohol so the fire would char some of the sugar off! My crepe came smothered in a very sweet Grand Marnier sauce. It wasn't too bad but it was too sweet for me. My friend's rhubarb tart was disappointing too, with some crumbly tart AND rhubarb paste under it. HMMM. I guess they don't do desserts very well here.No fear, come here for everything but dessert, wash it down with some Billie Salmon champagne, and go for dessert elsewhere. Enjoy!","115":"Great little brasserie in trendy Tras St area, a little slice of France in Tanjong Pagar. Unpretentious, but a place you could dress up for. Dimly lit, but with plenty of noise and conversation. \u00a0Service is relatively prompt. Waiters clipped and efficient but friendly enough. We ordered a salmon tartare($24) to share for entree, which was a good thing as it was a very generous portion, more than adequate to share. Avocado, lettuce, dill and capers made for a very fresh and tasty starter. My main was ribeye with bearnaise and frites ($48). When it first arrived it looked \"meh\", but a quick slice open revealed it was cooked to perfect medium rare done-ness. Nicely seasoned and with a good 'crust'. The bearnaise was EXCELLENT and I had to try hard to not smear More onto my steak and end up with a heart attack. Frites were pretty standard, but generous. My partner had St Jermaine scallops with spinach and porcini. Very tasty, well cooked scallops on a bed of spinach with what I think was confit garlic. Unfortunately we left no space for dessert, but I want to try that cheese plate....A special mention for the bread. Very, very good bread. Definitely will be back to try something else. Maybe the salt cod...or the rabbit....or the pork stew....or the lemon sole......or the welsh lamb....","116":"Best French brasserie in singapore. Interior design, service, food, wine, everything is there, good, attentive and authentic. The menu is well balanced between classic brasserie food and more sophisticated meals. I love the generous portion of foie gras, the fantastic quenelles, the list of Bourgogne wines...","117":"Last week, coworkers and I had the pleasure of having a business lunch at Brasserie Gavroche, an upscale French Bistro on Tras Street. \u00a0(Its sister restaurant Cafe Gavroche is directly across the street). \u00a0This was my first visit here, and I am now a huge fan. \u00a0The food, the ambiance and service were impeccable. \u00a0 The shop house's bright dining room is simple and elegant with french themed decor. \u00a0I'm interested to see how the dimmer lighting at night transforms the space into a different feel. \u00a0There's a full service bar near the entrance. The staff were on point. \u00a0The presentation of the large wood framed menu was impressive and there's a remarkable amount of choices in each category. \u00a0I selected the Ribeye Steak Frite ($48) and it was AMAAAZING! \u00a0The 300g portion of beef was perfectly seasoned and seared - crispy on the outside and perfectly rare on the inside. It's up there with Luke's or Morton's quality and one of the best steaks I have had in Singapore. \u00a0Served with a generous portion of perfectly cooked fries and bearnaise sauce. After we cleaned our plates and several glasses of wine later - \u00a0we ordered a selection of desserts for sharing. \u00a0Too high on life to remember them, but I had a bite of each and they were top notch (See the photos)The Good: \u00a0A nearly perfect lunch. \u00a0The Ribeye Steak Frite was delicious. \u00a0The staff was friendly and helpful.The Bad: \u00a0It's too pricey to be my new go to neighborhood lunch spot. \u00a0I would not be able to resist ordering the steak frite each time. \u00a0I must work harder to get a promotion and a raise.The Verdict: \u00a0Yes. Yes. Yessssss!","118":"Classic french bistro in the Tanjong Pagar area right by the financial core. Reasonable price, excellent wine collection, and attentive service makes this place a regular for me and my friends. Menu does change from time to time but what won my heart was their sweetbread, foie terrine, bone marrow, and when was the last time anyone attempted fish quenelles?","119":"For some reason, my family wanted to try French. So I did the usual search, read reviews and decided to try this restaurant and I must say, I am not disappointed at all.Located on a street just off the main thoroughfare of the Central Business District, the restaurant boasts a fine patronage of diners, mainly Caucasians and occasional locals. As you step into the place, you immediately get a feel of the Parisian air. We ordered the usual French fare; traditional onion soup, smoked salmon salad, shredded duck confit and the lobster and seafood \u00a0with bechamel sauce and the escargots done in burgundy and garlic butter.My daughter who had the onion soup exclaimed that the bowl seemed bottomless, so you could imagine the portions of the servings. My favorite was the lobster and seafood dish. The cream was not too rich. There was a generous helping of the seafood. Personally, I felt that the escargots could do with a little bit more of the garlic butter, nonetheless, what I had was pleasant enough. The service was impeccable too. The French butlers were attentive and non discriminatory, unlike others, who tend not to want to serve the Asians.This restaurant certainly has my vote for good food and good ambience. I will definitely make a second visit.","120":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and a second for dinner. Skip lunch and come straight for dinner!! Order the steak! Order the tartar..delicious! I don't know about you, but eating a large chunk of steak isn't usually how I do lunch--I'm a lady after all. I save my bloody meat thirst for dinner, complemented with some fine wine, and \u00a0Brasserie Gavroche definitely delivers. I dined with three others and we all enjoyed our meal. Well, I didn't enjoy my entree but I fell in love with the wine and dessert! We ordered the tartar, flank, steak, and veal. The steak was the star of the show--juicy and earthy due to the grass-fed cow from Ireland. Who knew Ireland produces such good steaks?! The next star was the veal. The description of the menu does not do it justice. Though I only had a small bite, it was everything I dreamed of but more! \u00a0I would personally pass on the flank and veal. The veal was my dish and I knew from the first bite onwards, I had made the wrong choice. Others in my party enjoyed it, but for me..meh. Though I had ordered the veal medium rare, it was tough nonetheless. I like my veal to be extremely tender and I really couldn't taste the difference between the veal and the flank. The flank was good, but nothing compared to the steak and tartar.For dessert, be sure to get the baked Alaska with brandied cherries! Once it arrives, they set it on fire in front of you! Hot damn! The chocolate is rich and dark and draws you in with the mouthful of brandied cherries. The Alaska is a decent size so I definitely recommend sharing it among friends. Brasserie Gavorche had a great wine list and for the price of the meal ($60 for food and wine), I couldn't have asked for anything better.","121":"Great, authentic French food. Quality is similar to something that you get in France or NY. However, the palate is definitely skewed towards being authentic rather than being adapted to local tastes. Meaning it's skewed more towards the heavier and saltier side. However, still great classic French dishes.I had the ox ribs and they were excellent. The meat was soft and falls off the bone. I would say that this is the dish to try at Gavroche.Decor and ambience is a 5 star. Would definitely be coming back here.","122":"Decently executed French cuisine in a beautiful restaurant. But the food is okay and way too expensive for what it is.It's a little above average, but the prices they're charging are not.We had a bit of everything when we went to celebrate a friend's return from abroad, and while we liked it enough -- we certainly didn't dislike anything -- the hefty bill was a tad detached from the reality of what the food really was.I'm going to have to think very hard next time someone wants to come back here.","123":"Beautiful little place with nice atmosphere. The hostess\/waitress was inviting and warm and very knowledgeable. Had the special of the pistachio chicken and it was wonderful!!! Glad we found it","124":"Brasserie Gavroche offers the quintessential French brasserie experience, a pity though the food isn't quite up to standards.Food : I wanted so much to like Brasserie Gavroche as I had heard rave reviews from foodie friends and the media had lauded it with glowing praises. However, I thought the French onion soup merely average and the fish quenelle with crayfish sauce similarly so. Friend who also had the French onion soup and the salted Mediterranean cod with crushed potatoes and olive oil concurred with her choices as well. Ambience : Very authentically French brasserie-like, I actually quite like the interior designService : Quite goodMost disappointing.","125":"We all have our favorite restaurants that we *almost* don't want to tell other people about - Buko Nero is one of those places.This tiny, family run restaurant seats at most about 23 and the intimate space and small staff (only the chef, wife as hostess, mother in law as hostess) add to the cozy ambiance. \u00a0The hostesses may not crack a smile, but they are informative and quick. The food is modern Italian and is worth the wait (you can only get a table with luck or by planning a few weeks in advance!)The food:The small, but tasty menu has a few regular items encompassing cod, a few meat dishes, mushroom soup with truffle oil, pastas, and starters (the prosciutto and mozzarella is a refined ham and cheese!) \u00a0But keep your ears open for the specials which may include anything from a charcoal crusted cod (no it doesn't taste like dust!) to a seafood ragu. \u00a0I'm simply amazed that the chef is able to create so many dishes by himself!We've had everything from the set menu (which isn't priced above S$55) to fish and pastas. The fish always has a crispy skin while the meat remains tender (I love the crispy cod with SE seasonings!) and the pasta is cooked al dente with a variety of tomato based sauced. \u00a0The food is comforting and well executed. \u00a0The sticky date pudding is reliably gooey and delicious as well.I'll keep coming back to this restaurant for its great food and hope not too many more people find out about my secret place!","126":"Our favourite modern Italian food. Fantastic place, great ambiance, great service. Food is consistently good - absolutely fantastic","127":"Euro style restaurant with very interesting menu. It seems like they change their menu and specials so hopefully the below items still apply: 1) Food - cold cut plate: nice assortment of meats and good quality - pasta with uni - this was a special and the pasta was cooked perfectly with a very good amount if uni. Honestly any dish with uni will be awesome. - beef tamarind - this is melt in your mouth beef...I don't know how they can cook it like that. The tamarind is not that strong but I think that's good. The mashed potatoes were cooked very well for mashed potatoes.- raspberry panna cotta - I usually don't like raspberry but this was so light and flavorful I couldn't stop picking at it while sharing. My sister and her husband got the set menu (tomato orange sesame salad, crab bisque with tomato and broccoli, Mojito cleanser, ragu, espresso ice cream with cake) and they enjoyed that too but I think what I ordered was better but double the price...2) Service: Amazing, so helpful and very knowledgable about the food. 3) BYOB: Singapore alcohol is very expensive so bringing wine with corkage fee of $25 is worth it.","128":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Singapore right now. It's a very small operation, with just one chef in the kitchen and his wife and mother-in-law serving and running the front of the house. It's a small space with just 22-24 seats, so it has a very cozy and intimate meal. \u00a0Similarly, the menu is fairly short, but it changes regularly and there's always a special set menu of the day. The food is modern Italian with a light fusion-y touch. Some recent favorites were a pan-seared tenderloin wrapped in grilled eggplant, and a handmade linguini infused with charcoal and tossed with ridiculously sweet crabmeat from some kind of Australian crab I'd never heard of before. The desserts are always excellent, as well.Because it's so small, reservations are a must, often up to a month in advance. \u00a0It's worth the wait.","129":"One of the best kept secrets in Singapore, except it won't be much of a secret if Yelp has its way:)Italian-Asian fusion, cooked with love from the husband of the partnership while his wife serves the guests. They don't do it for the glamour or the money, its food and drink with passion. I would challenge to someone to pick something off the menu that wasn't below par excellence.... the set menu changes constantly, which is why I suspect regulars are happy to keep going back and being entertained.The Barolo was excellent and wasn't too expensive given the region. Tracy will happily guide you around the wines.Book weeks in advance and be flexible with times, its worth planning an evening around this one.","130":"I heard about Buko Nero before I heard of Buko Nero. There's a hole in the wall with a months-long the wait list. It's somewhere in Singapore. Wasn't until a new colleague and fellow foodie talked about how excited he was to be working in the proximity of the restaurant that I committed the restaurant to memory. Didn't even know it's Italian.For all the hype, Buko Nero is surprisingly affordable. A four-course dinner with amuse bouche and a palate cleanser is priced at $55++, you're only allowed to make adjustments to the main course for a slight price increase.And it's good food for the price. Italian home-cooked fare, strongly seasoned with Singapore and Japanese flavours. The star of the evening that I was there, was the Oven-baked cod with spicy crust, specifically the spicy crust. It's a product of intense love. The wife of this husband and wife restaurant team let on that they experiment frequently on the crust frequently. So what we had that night may not be the same as what we'll have the next time we order it.p.s.: There's no months-long wait list. Reservations are taken up to one month in advance.","131":"The one thing that greatly differentiates Buko Nero from most other restaurants is that one really feels at home. Literally. We felt like we were guests in a very warm and cosy apartment with great unpretentious food and wine, complete with soothing jazz playing softly in the background and lovely photographs on the walls.Food: Excellent! We had a complimentary amuse bouche of duck with plum crostini which was a nice teaser for the dishes to come. The Buko Nero tau kwa tower is deceptively simple, but is in fact a delicious complex blend of flavours. My main of cod with seafood bisque reduction (not on menu, one of three mains of the day) was marvellous, while my dessert of dark chocolate and peanut butter with strawberry ice cream was simply amazing. The peanut butter tastes somewhat like pureed min jiang kueh filling instead of the regular synthetic tasting variety one conventionally finds in supermarkets. Absolutely wonderful! Friend had wagyu beef carpaccio and Australian tenderloin and clearly enjoyed it.Service: Tracy was a good hostess, very attentive.Ambience: Warm, cosy and laidback. We felt totally at home.Buko Nero is definitely worth a visit, and several revisits. In fact, we both made our reservations for the next available date. I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu, including the pumpkin basil crabmeat soup, the salmon with nori, the cod with squid ink crust, the tiramisu panna cotta, etc. Buko Nero has a five course set meal for SGD 48 and they're quite flexible in that one can order the items off the set ala-carte or take the set meal and replace the main with any of one's preferred choice.","132":"Deron and I just went there yesterday, after making a reservation a month in advance. Of course, our expectations were high considering the reviews on yelp. The decor of the place was simple and almost casual, but it was nice and quiet. The service was great, very attentive staff, and the food is always served with a smile. They did not allow any pictures of the food, so unfortunately I can't contribute anything on that front, but I can tell you about the food! We were first served with a amuse bouche of cherry tomatoes, minced beef tartare and a pepper, and the one-bite dish was pretty good. The sweetness of the tomato complemented the saltiness of the beef. Next, we had a hamachi tartare with citrus, which was decent as well. The chopped hamachi was buttery, albeit a slight fishy taste, but the flavors were good. I had the basil, broccoli and crabmeat soup. The crabmeat was sweet, but the soup just lacks the umami flavor, just slightly salty and fell flat. I had the charcoal-infused home-made pasta with salt cod. The pasta had a good texture, obviously home made, although I could not taste the charcoal. Again, the sauce was just salty, with no other notes, and not much of a flavor profile. It wasn't bad, just wasn't very impressive. Deron had the smoked ricotta and beet risotto. The texture of the risotto was good, and the smoked cheese flavor was very good, but it was served luke warm and was a tad too sweet (not sure if it was due to the beet), but at the end of it, it just tasted a little like cranberry. Again, I have to emphasize that nothing was bad about the meal, and perhaps we were just expecting a little more and it did not satisfy.","133":"Buko Nero has a casual upscale vibe which bodes well for good, honest Italian food. And I heard that the chef\/owner is Italian so I got my hopes up. Unfortunately I found the experience to be underwhelming. They had a hamachi carpaccio as a special appetizer that sounded interesting. None of the other specials grabbed me so I ordered the risotto entre off the main menu. I really liked the concept of the hamachi, but the delivery was stunted by the hamachi itself. There was more than a bit of a funk to it; definitely not sashimi-grade so it should not have been served raw. And the risotto was flat. I'm a sucker for a good risotto, but this one failed on every level. The rice was chewy, almost crunchy and there was no umami. Overall just bland a chalky. I've heard good things about Buko Nero so perhaps I just order the wrong things. Maybe I should have asked for more guidance from the nice hostess, but I don't think I'll be back to find out.","134":"Gorgeous food, excellent service and nice ambience. \u00a0The chef is creative, thoughtful and detail to attention. \u00a0The set dinner is great value for money and the daily special is fantastic. \u00a0Excellent for date night or group dinner. \u00a0Will be back!","135":"One of the secret addresses in Singapore - although I'm not sure why: is it because of its size or its interesting fusion cuisine? It certainly is tiny (can only accommodate 20 people at the same time) and has an interesting fusion menu that combines South Asian and Italian cuisine. Impossible to get a table without reservation before 9 PM. The interior is modern - white being the primary color, and the service very personal (all in the family).Some combinations are interesting.","136":"This is my new favorite Italian Singapore!The food is great. \u00a0Being Italian, I do not usually think of italian as haute cuisine. \u00a0This place managed to make it interesting. \u00a0We got the autumn testing menu, and it's the first time i find porcini so good in Singapore!The service is fantastic. \u00a0Gabriele saw that my wife is pregnant and suggested that they could adjust the menu for her, without us even asking. \u00a0Plus, i went for the wine pairing, and for each of the wine they brought an extra sip in a glass for her :-)Look forward to try the winter menu!","137":"Ok back in 2014. A year after my first review in 2013. Checking if the food and service is as good as before. We had a Father's Day meal with the family. All new menu had pasta, Parma ham, fish, pork and lamb. Food continues to be very special. Very very good. They were short handed this night with a full house. No one was flustered. Only 2 servers. Chef Denis even had to help with service. Nonetheless service was good. A little slow but why rush when you can take your time to savor the meal. This restaurant remains highly recommended. You will not be disappointed food and service wise. Only downside? It will burn your wallet, but hell, once in a while for someone special, go for \u00a0 It. It will be worth it.","138":"Yum yum and yum. Burnt ends was a fabulous meal in Singapore!We tried making reservations starting a month out, and everything was booked. We were bummmed, but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town. We were able to walk right in with no wait! We were seated at the high top tables, but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well. If you are in town without reservations, I would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it! If you have a choice, go with the table top seating.....you can watch the magic happen. Cocktails were phenomenal (one has burnt sage on top-super fragrant), and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates. The Jacobs Ladder (meat from between the ribs) was fatty and delicious, and had a great mustard sauce. The jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous. The pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor. The king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course, decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers (yum!). We are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in Singapore.","139":"This is one of the most disappointing experiences I've had in Singapore as well as dining at the Worlds's Top 50. When your reservation (that you make 3 months in advance) says \"bar seating\" what they really mean is wall seating. Your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall. When we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for. Fine. Seat us then. Our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini, we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalape\u00f1o brine. We tried several starters, Grissinni (simple and tasty), Jerk chicken (pass - it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo) and the Beef Marmalade (which was the best dish we sampled). The Marmalade was delicious. We also tried the Sanger sandwich (while good, it was missing an element of flavor). Maybe some spice could highlight the flavors? And last we were recommended to try the venison. Unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for. I expect more at this price point and for the hype. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere. I would have preferred roasted meat from a Hawker stall.","140":"Wow wow. 10\/10. Amazing. Phenomenal. Delicious. Mouth watering. An experience you can't miss. If you don't go, you messed up","141":"Very nice Australian Cuisine. Booking is essential. We booked 3 months ahead and managed to only get a \"bar seat\". That means you sit facing the blank wall on a bar stool, not the best for a social outing.The food was good and so was the service. I found it a bit rich. We started off with the Quails egg & caviar, followed by Grissini & Taramasalata. Both good. The Beef Marmalade and Leek, Hazelnut & Truffle were also good. I found the Pulled Pork Burger ordinary. The King Crab and Garlic Brown butter was excellent but rich. The final dish of Onglet was also nice.Over all it was a nice meal although most uncomfortable on a bar stool.","142":"Dinner Tip: Go line up a little bit before they open at 6p. Spots are gone in 15 minutes! Put your name down and come back when they call you.","143":"The restaurant was tiny in size with about 19 counter seat, 6 bar seats, and chef table which could seat 8. The day before I checked its website, and was able to make a reservation for its counter seat. As I was one of its first customers of the day, I was able to get the first seat next to the cashier, with a great view of the open kitchen. Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar ($12+)Gone in a mouthful, it was an exciting moment in the mouth, although one could not help feeling that it was quite expensive for an egg.Duck Hearts and Peri Peri ($8+)I was not quite a fan of duck hearts and expecting it to be quite spicy, but it tasted chewy with a hint of spices.Beef Marmalade and Pickles ($14+)Very nice with the freshly cooked marmalade on the toast, but a tab messy to eat.Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20+)Pulled Pork Shoulder, Cole Slaw, Chipotle Aioli, Brioche BunI had this takeaway after looking at most other customers having it. It was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it. Almost could not finished it.Onglet, Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow ($32.10+)I like that the steak was served sliced which made it easy to eat with a fork. I was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted great with the meat.Berry Tart ($12+)It was the dessert item of the day. Served with chantilly cream, although I wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it. Looked simple, it tasted quite good without too tart. I like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite.Overall food was great. Although the counter seats were full, the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal.","144":"Even though I've heard so much about this restaurants, it took me almost a year before my husband chanced upon it while looking for late night supper. We were greeted by servers with a strong Australian accent, \"Howdy mate\", and saw that the restaurant was still packed at 11pm. We managed to get the last two seats at the counter (basically the entire restaurant are counter seats) and was told that only the pulled pork burger was available as their restaurant was closed. So that saved us from making choices. My husband then asked if they had fries since I wanted some with my burger. Sadly the kitchen was closing so they didn't have any but we got the beef marmalade instead. In short, food was amazing! The beef marmalade was remarkable. Shredded beef in wondrous flavor on a crispy piece of bread. Pulled pork burger is probably a good portion for a main meal but perfect when we shared it for supper. The flavors were again a delight to my tastebuds but I have to be honest the pulled pork could be a little more tender. Probably a 8\/10 execution for the burger and 10\/10 for the beef marmalade. We also ordered a smoky cocktail - the bartender burnt the sage. It was lightly sweet and not overwhelmingly strong. A great experience overall and I am definitely curious to be back to try their other main dishes, which by the way, rotates frequently. Reservations are only taken for dinner seating between 6-630pm, and walk ins usually have an hour to two wait. Or you could wing it like us, come by for a late night supper dish!","145":"I love dining alone, and this night I happened to walk-in at just the right time to catch one of the last seats available for dinner. It was outside, which was fine as it was a cool March evening. I saw many people being turned away after I sat down. \u00a0 \u00a0I ordered the miso eggplant, the romaine salad, the steak, and a mint ice cream for dessert. This was a bit too much food for one, I realized late, but it was fabulous! I specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare, which I don't usually do, but it was so, so, so good. The steak comes with a small salad, so the romaine salad was really unnecessary - it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me. The romaine was the least successful of the items, it was strangely salty.  \u00a0 Make the time for this place when you're in Singapore!","146":"I had a great meal here on a Friday evening. I made my mandatory reservation 2 months in advance for a back counter seat. I got lucky when I showed up for my 6pm reservation and was told a seat at the front counter watching the kitchen wasn't needed until 8pm. Score! It was fabulous watching the staff work like a well-oiled machine. I started with a delicious whisky drink and then had the smoked quail egg with caviar. The smokiness was lovely. Then I had the meat marmalade (minus the aioli as I'm not a fan of aioli-yummy!), pork belly with apple and raspberry pur\u00e9e (yum!), and the leeks (OMG good!). It was all outstanding! And let me tell you...get the leeks. They were buttery and had hazelnuts and were chargrilled. I still remember what they taste like. Just go and eat some for me.","147":"There are times when you do pay lots for a meal and leaving the place feeling worth every single cents? I would say this is the place. \u00a0Every thing from the food, the service and the ambiance was just wonderful. \u00a0We were lucky enough to get the seats closes to where the action is. \u00a0Seeing how the order comes in, the sou chef calling out the orders, the busy cooks scrambling to get every piece perfect and back to the chef finally taste to serve. \u00a0Think there are more than enough reviews already (will just add extremely detail pictures to tempt whose unconvinced to part with their hard earn $$) so i won't say more except the 650G beef though a S$380 hit was the best!! Also a surprise was that the dessert was good too!! \u00a0You would think BBQ guys can't do desserts? \u00a0Think again! Great job guys! Just go ahead and include 10% no need to put a big note and hint of NO SERVICE CHARGE. \u00a0You deserve every cent of it don't be shy as you are not on your Qs.My son loved their food and decide to do a video of them:youtu.be\/jAWat0YZ-CE","148":"This place is so, so, SO good. Great experience, great service, great food. I cannot handle this place. Some must-orders:-Sanger- Alaskan King Crab- Meat Marmalade x1000000 plates. It's that good. - Jamaican Ginger BeerAll the food comas following a meal here are worth it. You have to trust me on this one.","149":"My favourite restaurant in Singapore. Burnt Ends gets it all right. The meat and seafood will blow your socks off. Dishes that at first appear super simple are, after diving in, deeply complex. This started with snow crab leg in herb butter, roasted leek, eggplant and then moved on to the ' Burnt Ends Sanger' (amazing!) & rump cap. Sounds like a lot for two, but the dishes are small and perfect to share. We finished with the sugar cake and smoked ice cream. The cocktails and wines are phenomenal, but it's the experience and theatre going on in the kitchen as you sit at the bar that seals the deal. Go here. Yeah it's not cheap, but it shouldn't be.","150":"Fabulous dinner on recent trip to Asia.Chef David was preparing right in front of me! \u00a0Artistry and precision behind the counter.Wait staff was terrific as well.Highly recommended in a revitalized Chinatown.","151":"Sadly, a return visit in 2017 was met with a mediocre reception. \u00a0Seated outdoors due to not having a reservation, my guest and I were forgotten for about 30 minutes when the staff realized that they had not provided us with menus.Having made the recommendation to dine at Burnt Ends to my dining companion, I was sorely disappointed when the Sanger meat consistency was more of a tuna sandwich. \u00a0Other courses were, quite frankly, boring. \u00a0While I realize that Burnt Ends has made the recent top 50 restaurants in the world listing, I felt, well, burned by our experience.","152":"Burnt Ends is really a top notch experience from a food perspective. I never had a bad dish here on any of my visits and they are combining that with an interesting beer and wine selection as well as nicely crafted cocktails and to add to that the prices are, while not cheap, very reasonable. So with this in mind and the fact that they are highly acclaimed as well it should actually be five stars and they could so easily be given that from me.The failing is however the service. Part of the service is fine and that would be the chefs behind the counter. They make the food and manage to be friendly and do a bit of talking to customers as well. The waiters and waitresses have however on every occasion been bad. First visit I asked the girl serving us how many dishes she would recommend for the two of us - response was 'how should I know howMuch you want to eat'. Great attitude. She was then mostly spending the evening doing very kittle and having another girl run around like crazy. Long waits to order, difficulty to pay have however been constant issues here but the food is so good that I keep coming back.","153":"You smell the food as you walk in. Open kitchen concept was also very cool. Nice to see your food prepared expertly and carefully by the chefs.Service staff was very attentive and also knew their product well, which is always a a plus for me.For my drink, I ordered their Rusty Grains cocktail, which is their very own barrel aged whiskey blend. Amazing flavor and aroma. Served simply in a whiskey glass with a nice big round ice ball. My date ordered the Happy Ending....which got a good laugh from the people next to me since I had to ask the female server for a Happy Ending....but yea all in good fun ahahaIt appears that they must have a rotating menu, (judging from the fact that there was a date on the menu hehe)Tonight we tried the Uni toast...if it's there just try it. Apparently I was the first to order as it was brand new and it certainly did not disappoint. Uni spread on a wheat toast with some toasted seaweed....oh man why can't butter be this good!Of course we had to try some steak! The server shows us the meat before the even grill it, which was a nice touch! We also had a squid pico de gallo and a pulled pork sand which.  Definitely a great date place. I will be coming back!","154":"Definitely recommend the chefs tasting option. They served us highlights form across the menu, including some items that were not even on the main menu. The roasted quail was incredible. Leeks with black truffle, incredible. smoked quail egg with caviar, incredible (duh). King Crab. Beef Marmalade. Roasted corn... my mouth is watering. Drink service was awesome as well. Great cocktails and aperitifs. The wine list was really carefully curated from Australia. Unique small producers shined on the list. We did sort of a tasting across the menu since we don't really know much about Australian wines, and the drinking was about as good as the eating.The service in general also stands out. Many staff ensuring the water was full, checking to ensure we were enjoying, clearing our plates, new silver etc. I broke a wine glass on accident right when we sat down and they were right there to sweep it up and re-set the table with new water glasses, silver etc to avoid any glass shards getting in the food. (sorry about the glass!)10\/10 would do it over again without hesitation.","155":"We went with the Omakase style (or rather, my friend ordered the omakase) so we managed to try out most of their dishes. The restaurant seating are mostly counter seats, and from there you can have a great view of the chefs scurrying across the kitchen preparing your meals. Sitting there also means you get a chance to interact with Chef Dave Pynt (and his extremely hot sous chef I think).The only problem with an open kitchen, as well as the background music, was that I couldn't hear much when the chefs introduced the dishes. For most of the dishes I didn't even know the names, really...But what I can highly recommend: - The BURNT ENDS SANGER (pulled pork burger). It was extremely juicy and flavourful, the only pity was that we had to share it among us friends. I could eat the whole thing by myself for sure! This is one of their signature dishes.- Blackmore's Cube Roll. I think this is steak that we ate. Done medium rare, it was well grilled and seasoned, and the quality of the meat was obvious. The only con to this was the almost $140 price. This is one of their signature dishes too.- Alaskan King Crab and Garlic. Oh man, the king crab was very well cooked over the garlic sauce. The sauce was well prepared, no taste of bitterness at all. Dip a piece of sourdough bread in it and devour it. Savour every last bit of the sauce. Surprisingly, this is coming from a restaurant known for their meats.If you haven't eaten at Burnt Ends, reservations (as of this past weekend) are filled till September. Talk about a long wait!Pros:- Great view of the kitchen and chefs working- Amazing food really, they are known for their meats- Good and warm service from both chefs and floor alikeCons:- Might be considered expensive; Our bill came up to about $150 per pax- Long reservation wait, if you DO manage to get it- Noisy restaurantant","156":"Burnt ends is a spot that I walked in with extremely high expectations towards, with recommendations coming from multiple fronts. My gf and I dined at Andre previously and Burnt Ends was mentioned highly even from their staff so we took the plunge and made the reservation, preparing ourselves for eating some MEAT.We had the early 6 PM seating on a Wednesday so arrived right at 6 on the dot and had the first two counter seats. The ambiance immediately strikes you as a cool and hip place with old school punk rock music playing and young chefs hailing the kitchen. The open kitchen + counter seating setting is always a plus, allows you to watch and wow over the entire process from the moment you order your food, to it being announced, to preparation, to cooking, to serving. Each of their 10 visible chefs with different roles and stations - totally makes for one incredible experience even before you taste your food.We ordered the following:1) Leek with hazelnut and black truffle - nice tasting and perfectly grilled leek except was way too salty for my taste. This is subjective yes but even in being lenient, this was a bit much. The black truffle was even overpowered by the salt.2) Garlic shoots and gremolata - Great starter. Not too overwhelming of garlic.3) Fennel, Orange and Burrata - Loved the fennel and burrata but the the orange syrup was a bit too artificial tasting and didn't seem to belong. It took away from the freshness of the rest of the dish for me.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger (Pulled pork shoulder, home made cole slaw, home made chipotle aioli, brioche bun) - Loved this. Can eat 4 of these.5) Suckling pig for 2 - Good but be prepared to work! Excellent flavor from the charcoal grill.6) Burnt Ends' Sourdough - Your typical sourdough.Overall the food was nice. Definitely worth a shot but unfortunately I wasn't wow'd by any means. The Sanger was excellent and I'm sure they can make a shop purely from these. I also took a star off because of their lacking dessert and cocktail menus. Not sure if they are hoping people only eat and get out kinda thing but with the kind of setting that they have in there, an awesome cocktail and creative dessert would go long ways to make the place and experience totally memorable.Otherwise, I would recommend you check it out. I know I'll be back to checkout their new menus in the future.","157":"Burnt Ends, owned by chef-restaurateur Andre Chiang is currently ranked No.14 in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2016. With Australian Chef Dave Pynt on the pass, Burnt Ends have caused quite a stir in the Singapore food scene with their incredible barbeque.During my trip to Singapore, I did not have the intention of visiting this restaurant and therefore did not make any reservations. But when I was looking at Singapore's Burpple Top 100, Burnt Ends was at the top and I just had to give it a try one way or another.With only 17 coveted counter seats, it was quite a challenge to secure a place in their restaurant. So when I tried to make a reservation during the same week, of course they were fully booked. Luckily, there are walk-in options for people that could not get a reservation.When we arrived, we were fortunate enough to snag two seats right at the end of the counter! We were so thrilled to try out what they have to offer.The way Burnt Ends operate differs from other restaurants. Approximately half of the counter seats oversee an open kitchen that is dominated by a four-tonne, dual cavity oven fired by fragrant apple and almond wood. You can also feel the hustling vibe of all the chefs and watch them as they skillfully prepare your food. I wished we were seating there instead. It would have been a totally different dining experience.We were very satisfied with the food as well as their service. Too bad there was only so much we could eat (and limited funds). There was so much more that we wanted to try on their menu - their Squid, Venison, King Crab, Seabass, it all sounds really good! They have clearly mastered their barbecuing technique and their dishes are very affordable. Until this day I am still dreaming about their perfect-rare onglet steak. I look forward to return to Burnt Ends again.","158":"Excellent attention to detail on everything but the seasoning which is why I can't give it a 5 star. Superb chef skills and an excellent experience - would highly recommend","159":"Love the smokiness of the food. My friend did as well. The queue is fairly long so be prepared to stake it out We both loved the intense beef marmalade. The burnt sanger didn't live up to the hype for either of us. My friend also adored the fennel. I personally felt the fennel flavour was good but the actual fennel didn't have as a strong flavour as expected. I put it down as Singapore not having a great produce selection. The fennel was also a touch over smoked\/burnt. The rump steak had an amazingly reduced onion puree. It was a perfectly balanced condiment to the beef. The suckling pig was probably the most underwhelming. The cider reduction was great but there wasn't a lot of it. The skin was nice and crispy. I loved the skin. The pork itself felt a little under seasoned. It was cooked very well but that was all to it. It felt like a slight dissapointment after all the other food we had.I dare say that burnt ends will continue to draw in the crowds!","160":"This is a beautiful restaurant with bold, interesting flavors. It's a good thing it's so hard to get a reservation, otherwise I'd spend way too much money at this place.","161":"Burnt Ends proclaims itself as a modern Australian BBQ, and the star of the show is certainly the grill and flaming oven. \u00a0But then again, Outback Steak also proclaims itself as an Australian steak house, but the two comparisons couldn't be further apart (thankfully). In a modern and minimal room, most of the seats are on the counter, with a few tables in the back. \u00a0The menu follows the current trend where you list only the ingredients. \u00a0So for our first course \u00a0it was simply listed as leeks, hazelnut, and brown butter. \u00a0And sure enough, that's what we got, but it was completely awesome - the leeks were grilled perfectly and sweet and tender, while the hazelnuts provided an excellent counter, and all swimming in a rich yummy bath of brown butter. \u00a0The Sanger was also one of the best sandwiches I have had in SG, \u00a0It's basically a pulled pork with cole slaw, and aioli which was super messy but on par with some of the better bbq sandwiches I have had back in the States. \u00a0The lamb with harissa was good, although my chop was a little grisly. \u00a0Do get a steak - even the cheapest version, the Onglet, is very good. \u00a0It's basically a hanger steak that is grilled perfectly on the rarer side, with bone marrow and a very rich sauce. \u00a0Service is efficient and competent. \u00a0My only complaint is that I would not serve a Belgian Abbey ale in a tall glass, but it's a minor issue and one that could be remedied with a wine glass (not perfect but certainly an improvement over a tall glass). \u00a0 \u00a0Anyway, DO make a reservation. \u00a0The place is small and fills up quickly, even on a Wednesday night. \u00a0And definitely try veggies as well as meats, as they handle both deftly here. \u00a0And they also have quite a few barrel aged cocktails, which I will definitely have to hit up next time. \u00a0The little plates can add up pretty quickly, but it's definitely worth it.","162":"Delicious meal, but you gotta order carefully. Most of the dishes are very small and it's quite hard to determine which plates will make a full meal. Be sure to discuss with your waiter. The menu changes seasonally, but there are a few staples including the pulled pork sandwich (probably the best value for money on the menu). Come early, come often.","163":"Food was good but the service (or lack of) ruined the experience. We reserved the Chefs table for 8pm on a Wed night. We showed up at 7:45 and were told the table wasn't ready. The hostess then asked us to stand outside and order cocktails while waiting. Once we stepped outside, no one came to take our drink orders the whole time we were waiting for our table to be ready. We had to ask the waiters to clear our plates several times throughout dinner and the servers forgot to explain most of the dishes.","164":"Tried this place in May 2016. On the day we intended to go we tried 4 times to call for a reservation, but no one ever answered the phone. There is no functioning online reservation either so we had to play by chance by showing up without a reservation. This alone knocks down the rating...even if they are full up for the evening then at least answer the calls to inform patrons.Once we arrived (about an hour after dinner shift started), the place was bumping with people and music. Had a nice trendy vibe and decor and was exactly the type of atmosphere we had expected from the reviews. There were a couple small tables outside (both occupied) and what seemed like no vacancy inside. We asked the hostess if they had an availability for 2? She was helpful and said she'd look around. While waiting we took in some of the ambiance and surveyed the whole restaurant. The floor plan of the dining area was blended tastefully in with the kitchen, very open. The chefs were busily preparing the meals right in front of the customers. When the hostess returned, she mentioned that they only had room at a narrow steel-mesh bar adjacent to the entryway. The mesh bar sat about a foot off the wall and with black painted steel bar stools had about 5 place settings. I'm not a big fan of this type of seating for eating but for a bar it would be ok. This actually is the other reason the rating is knocked down. The mesh bar was too tight and I felt a bit uncomfortable with such little space. I mean if we're gonna drop 150+ on a meal at least design some better seating solutions.","165":"This is our second time to come to Burnt Ends. And it is now on our list to come every time we are in Singapore. Not only is the food excellent, but you get the full kitchen experience by watching them prepare all the dishes. It gives you a real good appreciation for what it takes to run a top notch restaurant.","166":"Tried this place out after all the rave reviews and hearing so much about it. Deeply disappointed. Firstly, no reservations so you have to go and get in by 6pm to try to get on the waiting list. Then you have to scoot off somewhere to have a drink or kill time. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to be seated at the side tables facing the wall. So you can't see any of the kitchen action and they were the most uncomfortable stools and tables. Unbelievable how they maximise space and charge the prices they charge and have such seats. I get it that Singapore space doesn't come cheap but still???Food was unimpressive. We had the smoked quail eggs, cauliflower dukkah (which was the most impressive dish we had that night), onglet steak with marrow, the brioche with bone marrow. The steak did not impress at all and we both felt at the end of the meal that it wasn't worth it at all. Will certainly not go back for another meal. The staff there also weren't helpful and had an attitude.","167":"Delicious.I had heard about it from a foodie friend, and called ahead to see if we could get a spot that Friday night, which also turned out to be their opening night. Eep. Manager says come early, resto opens at 6, and they might be busy from 730, so we made plans to get there EARLY.It's 6.30, and we're pacing our walk to the resto - we didn't want to get there too early, lest we appear too eager... I lie, I really couldn't be bothered about appearing eager. After all, I was showing up on opening night, 30 minutes after they open their doors for service. And we weren't even the first ones there. Oh well. Silly accolade aside, we got down to the menu, and watched the crew work in front of us. Yes, it's one of those counter-seating placers where you get to see everything happen in front of you, and it forces the crew to be ultra clean, and ultra deliberate about every step.Yum points to the warmed oysters abd baby eggplant; the latter blackened to tasty perfection (everyone needs a little char in their lives) and with a touch of sambal on the side (with hae bi!). We also shared the roast suckling pig, which was crazy delicious- crispy crackly skin, with super juicy flesh, and Chef Dave shared that since they didn't want to take away from the pig's natural flavour, he'd let us salt the dish ourselves. Smart man.Dessert was an ice cream sandwich - really, chocolate ice cream between two brownies, and the smoked ice cream with wild hibiscus, which was a very interesting end to the night. Go ahead, imagine smoke, in ice cream, in your mouth. The come here and get all those pre-conceptions blown away.","168":"The food is five stars, the experience the same, flexibility and fitness for a group of friends, 2 stars. I did an extended three course lunch, and the food was realy good! Pulled pork starter was excelent, but a bit big. I might have only that one next time.The one problem I have is that they don't take reservations, and that there are few tables. They have a long counter where you can sit and see the action in the kitchen. That's great, and works fine if you are only yourself or with one friend. Wanna eat with with a group of friends, then it's a problem. Shame since the food is fantastic.","169":"One of a highlights of a short but fantastic Singapore food trip.A small restaurant with counter style seating. I didn't make reservations and was lucky to find seating for two even though it was late during their lunch time. I highly recommend reservations.Even though we were seat away from the kitchen half, it's a nice touch to see Chef Pynt and his excellent staff do their thing. The service was excellent and very friendly.I wasn't sure what to expect from Australian barbecue, but it did not disappoint. The Burnt Ends Sanger I think is best described as a friggin delicious twist on the pulled pork sandwich. The Cube Roll steak was also exquisite. Quail eggs were good also.Not sure I will be making many more trips back to Singapore but there's a very good reason some rank this as one of the top restaurants in the region.","170":"Finally got there. Awesome. Want to go back for more! Excellent service. Friendly and knowledgable staff! Food??? \u00a0Well you will have to make a booking. Great smoked meats and small side dishes!","171":"One of the coolest open kitchen concept restaurants! Hands down the the best hanger steak also known as the Onglet ever. It's cooked to perfection and served as a snack rather than an entr\u00e9e. It takes about 45 mins from order to table but every bite is worth the wait.","172":"First day in Singapore, saw all the great feedback for this place so I thought I'd give it a go... I can confidently say this this is every foodie's nirvana... Open kitchen (a sign of confidence from the chef) and everyone is sat around the comptoir overlooking the kitchen...menu is revised and changed daily... Everything on that piece of paper looked fantastic to me... Everything is super fresh, they'll even tell you when they run out of ingredients for each dish.. These guys do NOT do bulk or industrial cooking... The starters are the stars of the show... There is nothing on there that you wouldn't fancy... It's just unreal how they can ace 2 dozens different dishes everyday... I've been to many amazing places and had amazing food experiences, but I can confidently say that if I was ever to live in Singapore, this place would be one of my weekly regulars...If you love great food you'll want to marry this place..  Simply TOP NOTCH","173":"Very exciting atmosphere, sitting at counter across from hard-working and dedicated chefs who are so passionate about preparing incredibly flavorful and creative food. We took a detour to Singapore on our Asian vacation just to eat at Burnt Ends, and it was SO worth it. \u00a0One of the best meal experiences I have ever had. \u00a0NOT TO BE MISSED, especially the Beef Marmalade.","174":"The food is excellent, let me just put it out there. If you're surfing for a place to eat on a Friday date, hurry up and go down now and chope a table (or make a reservation if you can eat at 6.30pm). The service we received however, is what made me dock a star.Let's start with the happy stuff first aka my stomach. We had the fresh pearl oysters to start. That's right, fresh and cold, not warmed (why would you warm these babies?!!). I haven't had such fresh, non-grimey, smooth tasting oysters in my life. I don't know what the chef did while he shucked these babies but man. Oysters!Then we had the grilled courgette show up with the Sanger. Think slices of perfectly grilled courgette with lovely waves of oven hei wafting in your mouth, followed by a thick mild cheese and a puree-ed vegetable 'sauce'. The pulled pork sandwich was tender, sandwiched between a willowy bun made by I'm guessing the stern looking baker lady who paced up and down to the ovens where her sourdoughs were baking. The sandwich was well sauced and had a good dose of cabbage but I *have* to say, the sauce was a little flat. It had some spice and perhaps a mayo base, but \u00a0lacked the smoke or sweetness you'd get in the South or at Smokey's in Singapore. Same same but different (interesting) take. Between these dishes and the next 2, we waited more than half an hour before realizing the servers were waiting for us to finish the burger. I was dying from hunger and it was only when I asked the waiter why 1\/3 of our table got their food, did we realize there was some systematic course. Given that the menu isn't labeled as such and our host was politely *not* eating his Sanger, I'm going to bluntly say the waiters should have used their brains and asked why our plates weren't moving. Mind you once we figured this out, the kitchen still had to cook our food and we waited another 15 minutes. So the last 2 dishes were the flank steak and the king crab. The flank tends to be a cheap cut, not so much fat, since most cows have well exercised abs. This steak was grilled perfectly medium rare with some bits of fat left on top for good measure. Why would someone torture me like that? The king crab was the weakest part of our meal and word of advice, not the best thing to eat when you're having a business lunch. It wasn't bad per se, but somehow a crab leg with fibrous meat doused with butter and a squeeze of lemon didn't quite knock my socks off (now the shrimp at Blu however...).All round great food. The open kitchen is also hugely entertaining, especially when a table sent back their steak because someone messed up. Think Gordon Ramsay action without the f words yelled out loud. I saw one sous chef taste off a common spoon after putting the finishes to a plate, and place the spoon back in the common utensil basket. I squirmed for a second, but since it wasn't my dish up next, got over it. So yes, don't expect intelligent service and you'll have to push them abit if you're on work time. Otherwise, the food coming out of the kitchen is amazeballs.","175":"Spoiled again with a dear friend and \u00fcber foodie flitting through Singapore en route to London. Much anticipated, @burntends_sg didn't disappoint. We could have ordered another round of the #beefmarmaladeandpickles #perfection. Love that most of the meaty dishes can be ordered by the 100g portion meaning even 2 people can #shareplates and have variety. Intimate space, good service e.g. We were warned of the 45min wait for the rumpcap","176":"Aaaaammazing. Just ask the server what the most popular things are and order those. There is one sandwich in particular as small plate-- to die for.","177":"Burnt Ends makes the barbecue an exquisite affair. You wouldn't expect barbecued fare to be this polished, but Burnt Ends' mastery of the grill is inimitable. Prices are a little steep, considering the tapas portions of most dishes, but well worth it.Service was extraneously amiable and chipper in attitude, as Burnt Ends doesn't charge for service. And because the menu was impossibly succinct, scant almost, the staff's fair grasp of the menu helped inform our choices.We had:1) Smoked Quail Egg ($15 each) - topped with caviar: the minuscule mouthful costs a pretty penny, but wow was this glorious. I finally get why caviar is prized as a delicacy. These inky black pearls lent a plush briny counterpoint to the nuanced smokiness of the perfectly soft quail's egg. An absolute can't miss. 2) Tomato Toast & Lardo ($18): looked rustic but was exquisite. The blobs of tomatoes, lightly torched on the grill, were bursting with an incredible sweetness.3) Beef and Mustard ($18): my favourite version of beef tartare ever. It was clear and refreshing, the bite of the mustard restrained the rounded body of the beef.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20) with pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw, chipotle aioli, and melty cheese sandwiched between a pillowy sesame seeded brioche bun: TO-DIE-FOR. Best pulled pork burger I've ever had in my life. In fact, best burger I've had in a long time. I'm still dreaming about it.5) W.A. Marron ($90) accented with kombu and gilded with tobiko beurre blanc and chives: sumptuous and succulent.6) Onglet ($35.10 for 150gm at $26\/100gm) topped with burnt onion and slathered in the most divine marrow jus: Decadent and heart palpitatingly sinful but so wonderfully superb.","178":"You have to make reservations for 6pm \/ 6:30pm seatings around a week in advance, otherwise it's trying your luck 10 minutes before they open at 6pm. I thought the food was ok, but not exceptional. Had the tomahawk pork, the beef (tenderloin?), sanger and a few other dishes. The only dish I found remarkable was the almond-onion-something salad. The meat dishes I felt were meh, and the sanger had too much \"wet coleslaw\", not to mention it was on the salty side. The wine selection is good, both in terms of quality and the decent mark-up.","179":"Ugh. So good. I practically loved every single dish we got. I had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times... and I finally did! :D so without further ado, here's what we had:Smoked quail eggs white truffle - it's good, but for the price of $12 PER EGGS i wouldn't get it again. i thought they'd at least give 2-3 eggs for that price, but no. it was really $12 for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle - yummy, but not worth the price tag!Squid, sweet corn and paprika sauce - this is an excellent dish. i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was, and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce. even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish (but I ate anyway) was tasty as hell.Onglet, onion and bone marrow - soOooO sooooo good. the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked, but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i didn't pay too much attention. they didn't bother asking us how we'd like it done, but it came out just perfect. the meat was perfectly seared on the outside, and so juicy and so pink-tender on the inside.Burnt End's Sanger (pulled pork burger) - ok, could you tell I saved the best for last? cause I totally did. this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison. and then we got seconds - it was THAT GOOD.Banana with Caramel - this was a lovely dessert, though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger - i felt like it really stole the show for me....anyway, i digress. the banana was nicely done and flavorful, though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert. thankfully it wasn't massive or anything, so we didn't struggle with it.Totally would come back here again - there were many dishes that caught my eye that I just didn't have the stomach space to try.Update (Feb 5): went back and had the following dishes:- uni with cauliflower sauce- leeks, hazelnut- corgette- toast and tomato with pancetta- sanger- flank, onion and marrow- banana caramelWill update properly when i have the chance.","180":"1st visit. Organized chef's table for 8. Salmon skin and crackling - okSmoked quail eggs - nicely cooked with good flavorLeeks with hazelnuts and brown butter - delicious. Fennel, orange oil and burrata - goodSquid - sweet and creamy. Will try to dothis myself at home Pulled pork sandwiches with slaw - excellent. Savory meat with creamy slaw and a fresh bun. Must. Whole red snapper - decent but a bit overpriced at $60 OP 47 days aged ribs - ours was 1.345k and costed $500. \u00a0The burnt ends were amazing but this was overpriced. Desserts - apple, pineapple and banana. Had smoked, cinnamon and caramel. Was just OK but not outstanding. 411$160 per person for dinner and wineWould I return? Not v likely bc there are other places for decent food in SG. I wouldn't say I was let down, but I did expect more from an outlet tied to Andre Chiang. At this price level, service was average. The food was good but not amazing. Simple ingredients were cooked well. Had I not ordered the ribs or sangers, I would've left annoyed as I didn't see much creativity such as Lolla or Bochinche. There weren't many wow moments for me.","181":"surprisingly - and I mean that in the best way - good modern offerings at this new(ish) restaurant. I used modern because I am lax to use fusion - which often has negative connotation - this place serves up what I think is a very contemporary style of food: it straddles both eastern and weatern flavors perfectly well, and meshes elements and techniques to a cohesive and (if done right) enjoyable result.n.b. if you know a less rambling way to descibe that manner of cooking, I'd be well-pleased to hear it.competitively priced, enjoyable food with some standouts, a lovely restaurant and kitchen theatrics on show, this is my thursday recommendation for friday (or any day) date night.we were on a gander through keong saik friday night when we decided to pop in and try our luck - the first to arrive on the tail of someone's canceled reservation, so we scored a seat at the counter. it's a lovely space - intimate and exclusive. there's also something infinitely pleasing about watching your food being prepared before you.we started with the truffled quail eggs - really just soft-centred boiled eggs sprinkled with tiny truffle shavings and salt: alright, though nothing particularly alluring. the sea urchin atop cauliflower mousse was quite tasty - rich, soft uni atop the mousse, with tiny pearl-type seaweed for contrasting texture. the salmon roe atop crispy fish skin was more in line with what I expected from this place - the best way to eat this is to smear the eggs evenly atop the surface, so you get a bit of salty fishiness in each bite - pretty delicious. the mains here are expertly executed - it has a lot to do with that large oven (and grill ) they operate - the food comes full of delicious smoky flavor, perfectly cooked and tender inside, but with a delicious maillard-ed crust outside. take the fish collar - I forget the species - a large white with a blackened crust, cooked flaky and tender, juicy inside and well-seasoned; and well-complemented by the crunchy mixed seaweed. the onglet was similarly impressive - marbled beef in a dark jus, topped with sliced bits of marrow. that marrow was meltingly soft and heart-stoppingly (perhaps literally) rich; and you don't get to specify the doneness of the beef here, but it's no matter - it came pink and tender and beefy.\\and we finished with dessert: the recommendation of the warm apple was sweet, dark pieces of cooked fruit below a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with nuts. so comforting and delicious - a bit like grandma's dessert grown up.the food was of a consistently high standard (which might or might not be attributed to its pedigree), and it was well pleasing (especially for a restaurant that serves modern cuisine) that portions were fair and satisfying and prices actually reasonable. well-recommended, and a star amongst the new establishements. reminds me a little of the market grill - though this place is a little more sophisticated.p.s. they serve a suckling pig! up for advance order, and someone must have, because I saw the pig (not metaphorical) at the back. I think it's worth an order, because they hack it up and throw it on that impressive grill before serving - which must make for some deliciously charred skin and meltingly soft meat.","182":"Love love love this place .. Its kind of small - all food are being burnt, trust t name of t restaurant .. Totally burnt t food to perfection .. \u0086e are healthy and delicious .. \u00a0Bring your own fine wine .. Their wine list is abit short \u00a0But t palette experience is worth it","183":"Love this place. Consistently good food, the aged ribs are amazing. Everything on the menu is good. To top it all off, the service is fantastic, friendly, helpful, unpretentious.","184":"What a joke this place!!! Arrived at 7:45PM, we registered on the waiting list for 2 pax, we were told they call us back in 15 to 30 minutes...so requested for a bar where to go for a drink...the girl was not able to tell us where to go. Then, guess....they called at at 11:20PM...obviously we had already our dinner in a very nice place close by the \"joke\"! By the way we went to taratata bistrot, perfect dinner!!!","185":"Love this place but the recommended 5 small plates and main meal was waaay too much for 2 girls (we mentioned we weren't that hungry). Food here is great - favorite is Jacob's Ladder and duck hearts. Crackling and mustard was good too. Lettuce isn't worth your while, skip that.","186":"damn. \u00a0the grilled seafood was spectacular and even vegetables like leeks turned into mouthwatering yet simple spectacles in their hands. try the melt in your mouth quail egg with caviar ($15) and the intercostital cut (23) with the brown butter grilled leeks. haven't had a single bad thing here. \u00a0the waiter was a bit pushy though, asking us to order more and ahead of time though we wanted to take it slowly. be forewarned the dishes are small portions, hence pricier than average, and you're often sitting at the bar so conversation isn't the easiest in groups. \u00a0after dinner we headed across the street for another drink and snack.","187":"Appetizers are the stars at this place. The Sanger is worth having one to yourself - it is messy, drippy, tangy, but oh so delicious.","188":"The good: \u00a0Everything. The bad: \u00a0Lack of seats, ventilation and seats. \u00a0The ugly: \u00a0I really racked my brain to find things they could have improved on. \u00a0Maybe they could have given me a free sample? Maybe the drink list could be longer? Maybe the almost perfect playlist could have included better songs? \u00a0Maybe it could be a little cheaper? \u00a0Nope. \u00a0It's not perfect, but it's striving to be. \u00a0I arrived prime time on the weekend and therefore got stuck facing a wall. \u00a0Despite the grated table top and needs to be painted soon bare wall, I still had an incredible experience. \u00a0Half the dishes I ordered were familiar, the other half completely new to me. \u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00a0I also noticed that the menu had the date on it, which leads me to believe fresh ingredients are being used and the plates change often. \u00a0I think a total of 4 different people served me throughout the night, one of which being the head chef. \u00a0That sort of team atmosphere was transparent every time I got to swivel around to steal glances at the chefs at work. \u00a0You could write a book on the kitchen communication (mostly combinations of body language and singular words being muttered at an extremely low decibel). \u00a0My only regret was not leaving enough room for dessert, which I hear is on par with the rest of the menu. \u00a0Luckily, that's a wrong I can right in the near future.","189":"I'm definitely a fan! Highly recommended! Try it now before it goes mainstream. This is what good food os about. Reasonably priced and superb quality of food. Its a delight to see the chefs in action right on front of you.","190":"Mostly BBQ items. \u00a0Small restaurant with mostly counter only seating where you are up close watching the cooks. \u00a0No reservations accepted. \u00a0Most dishes are shared. \u00a0Sides were mostly good (enjoyed the tomatoes and lardo on toast and the pulled pork sliders). \u00a0Some things were under seasoned (Crackling with mustard was flavorless and bland. Needed more salt and mustard). \u00a0Sides and mains were each served one at a time. \u00a0Venison was too rare. Beef and Fish were good \u00a0 $170 per person. \u00a0(Had to wait for seats so each of us had 2-3 beers and several meats). \u00a0I can't say I would return. \u00a0Experience (counter seating watching cooks) was underwhelming and food seemed over priced. \u00a0Be prepared to wait for a seat. \u00a0Friendly and well trained staff","191":"Wow, what an impressive restaurant and such a fun and interesting dining experience. Walking in, I felt like I was walking straight into a well organized barbeque party as opposed to a regular restaurant. This takes the open kitchen concept to a totally different level. The oven and open grills are directly in the line of sight (really, the focal piece) of the diners. It really takes you right into the heat of the action, pun intended. We ordered the following:- smoked quail eggs: This was a wonderful starter and had a deep, smokey flavour. The eggs had an almost translucent, jelly-like exterior and a runny yolk. Loved the unexpected smokiness of the eggs. A nice introduction to the running \"smoke shack\" theme of the restaurant.- squid, sweet corn and mild paprika: the squid was sweet and succulent. Loved the flavours and the crunchiness of the corn against the soft flesh of the squid. Enjoyed the plating, with the wild pop of colours. - fennel, burrata and orange oil: very interesting to watch the blackened fennel come out of the oven. It was completely \"burnt\". Sous chef will slice the fennel in front of you, revealing the perfectly grilled fennel inside. - onglet, burnt onion and marrow: the star of the show. the piece de resistence. The sear on the steak was perfect and crisp and so tender insider. It was charred to smokey perfection and tasted amazing. The natural flavours really came through; delicious.- butterhead lettuce, shallots and vinaigrette: don't belittle this side dish and do yourself a favour and order this! I enjoyed this very much as it was possibly the only dish that was not grilled or placed in the oven (or was I wrong?). The very fresh, cold and crisp lettuce provided the perfect complement to the grilled and heavier dishes. I'd say that it's an essential order and really helps to balance out the oil and fat of the other dishes. - banana and caramel: this was a small banana burnt on the outside and caramel ice-cream on the side. A smokey and sweet ending to the meal. The meal went full circle, starting out with an unexpected dish of smoked quail eggs and ending off with a grilled banana. I liked how the smoked theme played throughout the entire dinner and this really did justice to the restaurant's name.It was also much fun watching the Chef David and his crew in action and feeling like you're part of the action in the kitchen. \u00a0I thought it was genius that the kitchen did not require any frying. Everything was done on the grill and in the oven. That's altogether brilliant and daring. We arrived on a Thursday evening at around 7 pm. No queues then and we were seated straight away. Service was good too. Overall, an enjoyable evening, albeit a smokey one as we came home smelling like barbeque which was of course to be expected!","192":"First of all, I have to specify that this review is based on my lunch there, not dinner. We started with the crackling and mustard, which is pretty much pork rinds with a mustard dip. I wasn't too impressed with it, except that the mustard was pretty good. Plus the fact that I saw them pull out the crackings from a tupperware, and it was served cold. Would have been much better if it was freshly fried. We had the sea urchin with cauliflower, which was 10 bucks a spoon. The uni was relatively fresh, and I liked how the black garlic and caulifllower puree complemented the sweetness of it, but it wasn't overwhelming good and didn't think it was worth the price tag. The grilled kingfish collar was as good as grilled kingfish kama gets, and I liked the green apple slaw that came with it. The pulled pork slaw burger was probably the best dish of all, with the juicy shaved pork and pickled slaw served with a hot brioche bun, albeit a tad heavy. I guess I came with great expectations, and I felt that it didn't deliver.","193":"A chance encounter with the documentary \"Food Heros\" featuring Peranakan chef Malcolm Lee got me interested in his restaurant, Candlenut in Singapore. Here I was, a week later... and what a culinary adventure!This is not your traditional Peranakan restaurant. Candlenut features many familiar ingredients that the Straits Chinese use, but it has creatively tweaked some recipes and on occasion created something new, the Buah Keluak ice cream for one. Having a non-discriminatory palate (and an open mind) is really the best way to make the most of your experience here.We went for the cheekily named 'ah-ma-kase' set menu which came with three appetisers, soup, salad and a selection of main courses. For appetisers, we had the Smoked Octopus Acar (spicy pickle), Kurobuta Pork Satay (tender, perfectly grilled, hints of paprika, accompanied by a sweet sauce), and the exceptionally delectable Kueh Pie Tee (wafer thin crispy shells filled with tasty crabmeat, subtle hints of lemongrass).Appetisers were quickly followed by Itek Tim, a savoury-sourish duck soup. Candlenut offered an interesting twist, adding spongelike taro stem to the soup and having the duck meat served as a meatball with minced mushrooms and pickled mustard cabbage.The main courses which came in generous portions, were served communal style. Mom's Curry Prawns was my favorite - giant prawns were first lightly grilled then cooked in a delicious lemongrass candlenut curry gravy. Grilled Red Snapper (drizzled with lime juice, lemongrass-onion-chilli sauce) was another outstanding dish. Duck Curry, aromatic from various ground spices, was cooked in a rendang style with the coconut curry thick and creamy. Wok-fried Pork Slices was another winner. Saut\u00e9ed with prawn chilli sambal and shredded kaffir lime leaves, it delivered a remarkably fiery punch, punctuated by the distinctive citrusy notes of the lime leaves. Prawn Wing Bean Salad offered a refreshing light contrast to the other main dishes but as this was nearly the only greens in the set, I would have loved for it to come in a bigger serving. After a complimentary palate cleanser - lemongrass granita, we moved on to desserts. The Mao Shan Wang Durian Ice Cream was every bit as mouthwatering as its pedigree would have you anticipate. It was also a pretty scoop adorned with flowers and a rose cookie. Steamed Banana Cake was light and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the accompanying Gula Melaka ice cream. However the star in this section belonged to the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Savoury bits of the distinctive earthly nut were mixed into the ice cream and there was also the delightful crunch of salted caramel. What a brilliant combination of flavours and textures.Traditional Peranakan cuisine will always be a part of Singapore's food culture. Notwithstanding, I applaud Candlenut's creative flair, and courage in pushing boundaries, and for its ambition to elevate Peranakan cuisine to levels of fine dining. Afterall didn't Peranakan cuisine evolve from an innovative fusion of cooking techniques and ingredients of 2 or more distinct cultures, necessitated in part by a need to adapt? Kudos, Chef Lee and his team.","194":"Came here to try Michelin Star fine dining restaurant. It was featured in the AAA magazine. They are known to use local ingredients featuring Peranakan cuisine.Service is relatively attentive. There was a minor incident that annoyed me. We ordered the prix fix and an a la carte dish, the waiter decided to not put down my request believing we may not finish the food. (I think it is is lame excuse that he forgot)The tasting menu is as followsStarts off with shrimp chips with spicy dipping sauce.Kieu pee tee with Bermuda tartare- great beginning love the crispy shell and the tangy fillingMaori lamb skewer- well marinated lamb that cuts the game and gain the flavorDumpling seafood bisque-full bodied seafood soup ( not really a bisque) with dumpling ( not very good dumpling the skin tasted doughy)The next course is family style of various dishes with white rice:Star fruit salad- refreshing palate cleanser between eating the heavy sides with there were more!Squid curryAn xin chickenCod fish tau cheo *Beef randan *Sambal telur And braised porkThe stated dishes were my favorite they paired well with the Starfruit salad. Very developed flavors of umami and spices The desserts was my favoritesCoconut shaved ice was a real cleanser from the heavy sauces dishes. It really calmed you after a stormThe nyonya Kueh selections were a delight paired with blue sweet pea blossom tea. I gave it 3.5 stars because of not getting the a la carte dish when it was our conscious decision. And not all the sauces dishes were to our palate. Kinda on the heavy flavor side. I hade to get two bowls of rice to eat the sauces dishes. The ambience is clean and comfortable. Very fusion tropical. I do recommend this place for a date if you are in Singapore","195":"Dining here was not the experience that I expected. The only good thing was the service which was impeccable, but one cannot eat the service. It can only go thus far. The ambiance was disappointing and the decor was dated.The food was doubly disappointing as well. The blue crab dish was good but other elements left a lot to desire. The dessert was the worst. It reminded me of a mixture of frozen artificial fruit juice, jello, ice chips and fake honey.Ambiance: 5\/10Noise level: 6\/10, 1 being the noisiest.Flavor: 6\/10Taste: 5\/10Return factor: 1\/10Recommend: 4\/10.","196":"\"Something taste like lemon Dawn\" \u00a0I whisper.\"Right?\" Whispers my dining companion through giggles.And that began what unbeknownst to me would be one of the best meals in Singapore.It just goes to show that you should not start off exploring a country's food with the most difficult to understand, and highly refined.Candlenut is a Michelin one star Peranaken restaurant in the heart of Dempsey. The food is uniquely Singaporean, the joining of Chinese and Malay food using the local ingredients.The dining space, part of a large warehouse, does not at all resemble a Michelin restaurant however, the food speaks for itself.Begin with a number of small plates. All dishes are meant to be shared. The kueh pie tee crispy shell stuffed with crab meat, seasoned with curry, and a bit of pickled shallots, almost taste of laksa. \u00a0The wing bean salad with baby radish, lemongrass, cashews in a calimansi lime dressing, the definition of texture. Extremely refreshing. Finally the crispy pork belly with pickled greens, outstanding. Think of the best Filipino lechon topped with crisp pickled veg, it's tight sour grip finishing with a gentle fermented seafood flavor. Excellent complexity.Mains crisscross the country. An excellent wagyu beef rendang, tender and extremely flavorful wrapped in a slury of cumin, turmeric, turmeric leaves, and other spices, wallops the pallet. The spice mix penetrates the meat all the way to its deep core. Not to be out done, a dish called \"Mum's Curry\" is equally deeply flavored. Tender, juicy chunks of chicken and potatoes and a deep rich curry mixture. Fresh peppers brighten the dish. Both are perfect spooned over some rice.The dish of the evening, red lion snapper simply cooked in a fresh chili sambal with charred garlic chives; incredible. The sweet flavor of the fish is accented beautifully by the fiery sambal. \u00a0A squeeze of calamansi brightens the flavor. Desserts, are also outstanding. It is hard to fault the Kueh salat with bangkit crumble and young coconut sorbet. \u00a0Hawaii yeeps, think of the best custard mochi you've ever had, add a light, refreshing, coconut supercharged sorbet and you have this dish.Service is informal and very friendly. As with most South East Asian countries, you must flag the server if you want something.Nice selection of wine however there is no better match to the food than beer considering the spice levels.Reservations required.Impressive to say the least. Save this for your final meal in the country and it will all make sense.Thank you Singapore.","197":"As long as you don't come here with really high expectations it was a good meal. The place was empty on a weds night and started filling up after 8. Keep in mind they don't seem to have a bar and serve mostly wines and beers. We got the omakase, the most memorable dish was the beef rendang. I'd come here for a chill dinner if your willing to pay for it.","198":"When I heard we were going to Candlenut for lunch, I was excited since I'm a fan of peranakan food and I've heard good stuff about it too. Ambience is nice... the place is done up really nicely decor-wise and it felt quite sophisticated yet traditional. There were 6 of us so we ordered a good variety of dishes to share. My favorite dish was the charcoal grilled whole squid with fresh yellow tumeric sambal - really tender and fragrant, and was complemented well with the sambal, which was very flavorful. I'd also recommend the babi pongteh (braised duroc pork cheek pongteh) which was super tender. The ayam buah keluak was tasty too though I wish they left the whole nut inside for the experience... The one thing I wished though was if the server had asked us if we wanted to have a portion of the homemade sambal belachan to try - $2 per sharing portion. I mean... yes it's on the menu, and I don't agree with having to pay for it, but the point is that they didn't even ask... and I found the food not spicy enough.. it's a peranakan restaurant after all right?Dessert was expensive and absolutely nothing to shout about. I'd give it a miss if I find myself back there. Overall, not too bad \"refined\" peranakan food but I think you can find better elsewhere for cheaper and with more character.","199":"With expectations set high on the worlds first Michelin starred Paranakan cuisine restaurant, I must admit that I was quite unfortunately, disappointed. \u00a0From the inattentive waiters and waitresses to the seeming slight imbalance in flavours (with perhaps an overly abundant overload on the quite heavily salted buah keluak) and lack of the expected extra \"finer details\" characteristic of highly praised restaurants in similar food eschelons, the experience was quite disappointing all around. \u00a0I will say, however, that granted, the flavours, portions, and service could be improved the dishes are quite photogenic.","200":"It was my first trip to Singapore, and I was beyond excited to visit the haven of street food and Michelin Stars. I was glad to have found just one Michelin restaurant with Singaporean roots. I honestly must say, I was disappointed. Singaporean food, boasting strong flavors and rich spices, was not accurately reflected in the meal I had.The jackfruit curry was mild in flavor, without the strong spice flavors.The sambal was very tender, but the meat was quite shredded and the flavor, again, not as strong as the rich street foods we had tried.Singaporean food all should have strong enough flavors that require it to be paired with rice, but my rice bowl was still near full. Some advice for visitors: although Singapore may have the most number of Michelin Starred restaurants, if you want a local Singaporean experience, stick with the food markets and the local restaurants to truly get the Singaporean eating experience.","201":"Candlenut @ DempseyGone upmarketAmbience much nicer than before.In premises shared with a Japanese restaurant, a mini Market, a bar in the centre of the premises and at the other end a French restaurant.The waitresses are no longer in kebayas. Why? Because it doesn't fit the new image.Saw the Chef walking around in a suit!Satay didn't have much of a satay sauce. It was just grilled meat. This was much better previously. They shouldn't have changed it!Crispy bean curd skin ngor hiang (minced pork, prawns & water chestnut) - not fragrant. The one at Singapura Seafood Restaurant is better.Wild caught baby squid, sambal belachan cherry tomatoes & red onions texture of squid was tender, sauce was good, cherry tomatoes good too. Overall it is tasty but a tad saltish.Tiger prawns, petai beans, tamarind & shallots - prawns don't quite look the size of tiger prawns. Candlenut's classic chendol cream, Pandan jelly & Gula Melaka - Super sweet.Food was very good before. Tonight it was only average. I would say it's okay tonight but unfortunately not worthy of its Michelin Star.","202":"Great food and excellent service.The best thing we tried was the Wagyu Beef Rendang, but we also enjoyed the charcoal grilled chicken satay, water spinach and Kueh Pie Tee. All were tasty. The fish chips they bring to start are also delicious.","203":"Can't be worse for customer service. Refused to let in customers who came 3min after 230pm as the \"kitchen had closed\". If you can have an incremental revenue, and there isn't significant incremental cost to opening the kitchen, it just boils down to inflexibility and a distinct lack of customer service and empathy. We had to make significant sacrifices to our schedule and beat the crazy Singapore traffic to just get here and then get turned away. There have been many other restaurants that have been many times more accommodating. Well, it is the first time I am here and it will probably be the last time that I am. Even though I never ever got a chance to taste the food, it has left me a strong and nasty taste.","204":"Candlenut serves modern\/fusion Peranakan food, and in our opinion, quite well. They moved from Chinatown to COMO at Dempsey. While the dining area is a little haphazard, there is a weird charm to it. We ate here before and after the star, and tried both omakase menu and ala carte items. The dishes are always on point. Waitstaff and cheerful and pleasant. Needless to say, we will be back.","205":"The decor was rustic with straw lamp shades. Fast service. We had starters with satay, stewed vegetables that you scooped into fried pastry cups and prawn crackers. Then mains with steaming hot rice, beef rendang coconut strength, vegetables in mild spicy sauce and coconut water from the shell. Good service with older waiting staff. KK had the chendol or green jelly with coconut. The flavors smacked of Singapore in the 21st century. The charm of old Melaka in the food was cloaked by the modern Sporean fog.","206":"The whole experience was disappointing to me. The food wasn't especially tasty there, even the garnish was so common that from nowhere I could tell this is a one star Michelin restaurent. Portion was small. The environment itself was ok but not as good as expected. Not sure about Singapore but with this price I would expect something nicer and more grand. Overall, wouldn't recommend this place.","207":"I actually think this is a great restaurant. All the items we ordered were excellent. Not only they were very tasty, they were also very unusual. The fried rice were black due to the spices but were incredibly tasty. Price was expensive but it is worth for special occasion.","208":"Bad attitude Reservation Lady. Zero service. Our first time to this place. Walking into Candlenut, the place has a great ambience which makes you feel like you will be having a good night and great food. Was looking forward to it. The problem is the ATTITUDE of the Reservation Lady. We booked a week before and she said couldn't find our name. Arrogance And Pompous ATTITUDE not to mention slowness and lack of response No APOLOGY And ARGUMENTATIVE. And all these was played out in front of the kids. It was so embarrassing. With the hype on this place, being a one Michelin , we had our expectations heighten too but it is intolerable not to have someone who understands customer relationship management. This was supposed to be a special night out but she messed it up.","209":"overall tasty fusion modern peranakan (Chinese Malay) with good service in a nice open lively setup in Dempsey. \u00a0not sure why the other reviews are harsh. \u00a0the portions are quite small but allows for sampling. \u00a0\"ahma kase\" menu available but tried a la carte: Homemade Kueh Pie Tee Shell Hamachi Tartare, Pickled Shallot, Laksa Leaf Pesto, uniqueWing Bean Salad, Baby Radish, Lemongrass, Cashew Nuts, Prawns, Calamansi Lime Dressing, great texture and refreshing flavorBuah Keluak of Braised Local Chicken with Peranakan Signature Black Nut Sambal, unique flavor, slightly dry but like a oaxacan moleGrilled Spice-marinated Blackmore Wagyu Beef Satay, yummyBlue Swimmer Crab Curry Turmeric, Galangal, Kaffir Lime Leaf, bold flavor and tastyBaby Sweet Potato Leaves Spicy Dried Shrimp SambalWestholme Wagyu Beef Brisket Rending Serunding, Turmeric Leaf, soft and flavorfuldessert with the buah keluak and chocolate also worked very well.","210":"This restaurant should more accurately be described as a peranakan fusion restaurant. I am a peranakan and frankly have not sampled an authentic peranakan restaurant in Singapore. Since this is a fusion restaurant, I did not have high hopes, in spite of them having won a Michelin star. The restaurant decor is sparse but pleasant. Service was very attentive and really friendly. 5 stars. They had a regular menu you would expect from this type of restaurant, but with twists to the traditional recipes. \u00a0For example, the ayam buah \u00a0keluak had decent flavor but the emphasis was the chicken, whereas traditional food is the opposite. Likewise the prawn petai, flavors were there, but the emphasis was the fresh prawns, not the petai. All in all the food was decent, but not spectacular. \u00a0If you are expecting authentic peranakan, you will be disappointed. However they were true to their advertisement, fusion peranakan. A downside was the pricing, quite expensive, about $70 per person.","211":"First and only Michelin star awarded to a chef of Sri Lankan heritage and it is in Singapore where he prepares Aussie - where he trained- inspired dishes. Does he merit the star? That I don't know, not eaten at many Michelin star to know that, and for what I ate I didn't feel like I was paying Michelin price (48SGD? For app, main and desert for lunch).All I know is, loved the meal, service (was served by co-owner\/wife Manuela) and vibe (was very busy, but chilled out).Do make reservation and check it out. I sat at the kitchen bar overlooking the chef who came over to chat up this hungry traveller.","212":"Outstanding. I actually hate vegetables but I try to go vegetarian once or twice a week. This place makes vegetables taste so amazing. Highly recommended for vegeterians looking for something good. Husband and wife were also nice people! Heard tempers flare sometimes but did not notice at all lol.","213":"I have been meaning to try this place because firstly it's new and there's something about the simple menu that intrigued me. Came here on a Wednesday night, although I had a rsvp, the place was not crowded at all and it seemed like you could even do a walk-in (if you hate to do a booking). Setting is more of a casual establishment, staffs are pretty friendly. The food:Ocean trout as appetizer - love the combination of tangy buttermilk, with a hint of yuzu. $22Rangers valley ribeye- thick meat, excellent marbling, well seasoned, simple and tasty especially with a dash of soy sauce. $55Barramundi with leek, bonito butter & caramelized onion - love this dish a lot too specifically both the butter and onion, they get along perfectly like bonnie & clyde. $32Rhubard with ginger caramel, lingonberry ice cream & roasted white chocolate - now this is mind blowing and this is coming from a person who doesn't really like desserts in general. This dessert is so creative, so delicious, such an excellent creation. We had to order this 3x because it's SO GOOD. It really is my kinda dessert. $15At least I know now where to get my dessert when the sugar craving strikes once a month. On an unrelated note, I personally don't like the presence of fans there, annoyingly disturbing and unnecessary. The aircons were blowing so strongly as well and in a weird way. When I asked them to adjust, they said it's not possible. So for those ladies who are sensitive to a strong fan blow like me, a shawl\/cardigan is totally recommended.","214":"I had high expectations of Cheek by Jowl. The food-sphere celebrity endorsements, the comments from my friends and coworkers, I expected my meal here to blow me away. I expected to stand up to Humpback, slap it in the face, and wrest my heart away with aplomb. Long story short, the meal was... above average but not unspectacular, and my favourite (not-ridiculously) expensive restaurant of the moment remains Humpback. But enough about Humpback; what went right and what went wrong and what went eh maybe at CbJ?Positive highlights: the Ocean Trout. The trout was delicious. Well executed, the flavours were fairly delicate, not in your face. It was a dish I'd order again, but not unique or novel enough that it's \"worth coming back for\". The much heralded confit duck with waffles... this dish. Wow. That five-spice caramel. The cucumber and mint salad on the side. This dish isn't a \"fine dining plate\" where you eat all the components together. This was an elevated chicken and waffles, fatty and sweet and rich and delicious, and the salad on the side is so you can refresh your palate and keep going. It's not a subtle dish by any means, it's a kick the door down and go HEY THE FLAVOUR IS HERE GUYS GUNS BLAZING dish, and while that might not be for everyone, it was possibly the saving grace for the evening for us.The black olive cake drew mixed reviews, but since this is my Yelp account, I'm going to say I loved it. It was clever. A brownie-looking cake that was slightly savoury, crumble that wasn't crumble (caramelised white chocolate crumbs) cream that wasn't cream (yogurt)... it was a dish of diverse elements, and as a slightly savoury dessert, my favourite kind.Oh shout-out to the padron peppers and hasselback potatoes. Solid small plates, those I'd order again without hesitation. Definite no-nos: Really, only the venison. Served under cucumber (or was it zucchini), with wasabi and fermented? Pickled? Plum, the plum destroyed the dish. A tart, acidic sauce like an inverse version of the plum sauce you see with roast meat at Cantonese restaurants, this tart gelee overpowered everything. All you could taste was SOUR. No matter what you ate off the plate, if you didn't first scrape off that dastardly gel, all it would be was SOUR. Urgh. I grimace just thinking of it.Everything else was... good. Not knock-it-out of the park good, but good. The slow roasted beetroot was excellent, right up there with most renditions I've had, but beetroot and goats cheese isn't rocket science, and it was served with puffed rice that had a granularity to it akin to sand. Not all of it was bad, but I had some mouthfuls were I was worried I'd chip a tooth, or felt like I was chewing on... sand. Yes. The Roasted Pumpkin? Just toooo many things going on the plate. Pumpkin. Nuts. Cream. And a relish? Wow. Just tooooo many things there guys. The Wagyu steak? A touch overdone when they seared it after the sous-vide (we're guessing they did a sous vide, the amount of unrended fat and perfect interior was unreal), the bottom and edges of the steak were effectively well done. Practically crisp. \u00a0Service was good. Friendly, eager, but not perfect. There were minor slip ups here and there, like offering dessert when we still had a main yet to arrive, putting a wine glass on our table when we hadn't ordered anything yet... but then even though we order the potatoes seconds before our main arrived at the table, it still arrived in time to accompany most of it because the kitchen clearly rushed it for us.All in all, Cheek by Jowl has some things going for it (the service team really is quite good, bar the minor not-critical mistakes), and I think the restaurant can only go up. Would I go back? Yeah if someone told me they wanted to. Would I opt to go back again on my own? Not at this point no.","215":"Excellent dishes with good quality ingredients with attentive service. Recommend the 5 course meal. The oyster, Baramundi, Lamb, desert were all really good. Will be back.","216":"I've had lunch here and it was absolutely perfect! We had the three course meal which consisted of an amuse bouche, surprise, starter, main course & dessert. It was delicious and even though we didn't have a reservation we were lucky enough to get a table. I like the modern & clean interior of this place as well as the fact that a\/c is not as freezing cold as in many other places in SG. The prices are reasonable and I'll definitively come back!","217":"Absolutely a gastronomy in taste buds (from start to finish) !!!! \u00a0Excellent service, ambience and the food is extraordinary. \u00a0Modern Australian at its best. \u00a0Recommended for date nights or group dinner and I am surprised that the restaurant is not more packed. \u00a0They are very good with dietary restrictions \/ preference too.","218":"Fried fish in soup - very good, think it's even better than the one at Paradise Teochew Restaurant.Wasabi prawns - okay but don't like it stickyChicken in a cage - niceCoffee pork and sweet pork (again that sticky stuff which I don't care for). I like the coffee pork.Tofu, shiitake mushrooms and broccoli - very nice especially the tofu.Fried kway teow - a bit burnt like it should be with prawns, vegetables and scallops - nice but I wish it wasn't sticky\/starchy.Coconut pudding with coconut ice cream - some of us like it but not me.Lemongrass jelly - lovely.$77 per head.","219":"Awesome braised duck! I love it. And it's often closed when I visit, sadly. The line is so long whenever I visit but it is definitely worth the wait. I still forget what days the store is closed. Because of the huge crowd, it is possible for the duck to run out. I have had it happen to my Friend. The duck is soft and tender and there's also really delicious braised pork. The egg and the tau Pok is good too. The braise sauce is very flavourful but yet the meats are still tender. Very worth it for $3! The rice sadly, is not yam rice, but is normal rice. Just get lots of sauce from the auntie! Two cute aunties working together. Delicious duck and sauce! Cheap and good deal, will be back often.","220":"Wow! Now i know and understand what the queue is about. Luckily for me, I was the third in queue and almost wanted to leave the queue. But I stuck on as I also dunno what else to eat. What a great choice I made to stay in the queue. I ordered kway chap with:* braised egg* daupok * pork belly slices * fish cake* preserved Vege All this for $3.50!!!!The braised pork belly slices is not funny kind of nice! Super flavourful! The braised sauce is good thus the Kway chap also shiok! My only complain is that the egg's outer layer is a little tough. Other than that, I had an awesome lunch!!","221":"4.5 stars. Excellent dim sum buffet in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. This is the buffet type where you sit and order from a menu and they serve you (as opposed to having a buffet line). Not cheap at S$68\/pax but I think it's good value for money given the quality of ingredients. You could order dim sum, cooked dishes as well as dessert (all included).We find the cooked dishes standard good like what you would expect from an upscale Chinese restaurant but the dim sum were excellent, in particular the Kurobuta char siew pao and siew mai. Desserts were ok.","222":"Wonderful place, secured, quite, nice waitress, good taste, good sets. Comfortable surrounding. Only non-convenient is no restroom there.","223":"I wanted to do something a bit special with Hubby when we visited Singapore so I decided to book Cherry Garden restaurant for dim sum buffet. It literally combines the two best things together: dim sum and buffet. Hubby was so excited for it and we even arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened for trading. We went for the first seating that started at 11 AM.The restaurant was quite grandeur and calm at the same time. The dark wooden furniture gave a very classy feel to the whole restaurant. Hubby and I were used to the bustling dim sum carts and noisy tables. I think it was quite calm because there were only a few people that morning. We quite enjoyed the warm and luxurious atmosphere at Cherry Garden. Yes, there wasn't any dim sum carts rolling around the place that morning. We ordered what we wanted off the buffet menu through the friendly staff. Our tea pot always got refilled promptly by them too. The menu also consists of soup & appetisers, desserts and other hot Chinese dishes (rice, congee, noodles, seafood, meat, vegetables).We started off with something light so we ordered the rice congee and a serving of hot and sour soup. The rice congee came with the century egg and shredded pork while the hot and sour soup contained a good amount of seafood in it. Both items look small in the photo but the size of the serving bowl was actually really good. We really enjoyed our deep fried Chinese-bun that came with chilli crab meat sauce. It was so yummy and if there wasn't any time limit on the buffet I'd just sit there and keep on ordering this dish (heheh).We ordered quite a few dishes from the dim sum selection such as chicken feet in black bean sauce, pork siew mai with baby abalone, juicy pork xiao long bao, and the yummy deep-fried escargot dumplings. I never seen or heard of any escargot dumplings before so we decided to order it. It was a sweet and creamy surprise! The Kurobuta char siew bao had a really fluffy exterior and juicy sweet meats on the inside.We really liked how the serving is suited for the number of people in your group. As it was only me and hubby, they gave us a small serving of the braised beef fillet. The beef was really tender and juicy.We really enjoyed our brunch at Cherry Garden and looking forward to go back there again next time we're in Singapore. The dim sum costs SGD $68 per person and there are two seatings available: 11 AM to 1 PM or 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. It's definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion as well although you might want to book in advance for weekend or public holiday seating.","224":"Considering this restaurant has earned a Michelin star, we had high hopes for our dining experience at Cherry Blossom, however it unfortunately fell very short on our expectations and we left feeling very disappointed. FOOD - We did not select one of their pre-fixe menus, but instead opted for ordering multiple family-style items as suggested by our waiter. We ordered the Peking duck, scallops, pan seared chicken, fried rice, and wasabi prawns. The food was mediocre at best, aside from the Peking duck - which was quite delicious and I would come back for only that. The other items were nothing special, and certainly not \"Michelin-Star\" quality in our opinion (and we're experienced Michelin Star diners).SERVICE - What a disappointment! For this caliber of a restaurant we were extremely dissatisfied with the waitstaff. \u00a0While our courses came out promptly, our table was constantly left with dirty plates for sometimes up to 10 minutes after we had finished eating. Disgusting. We also ended up pouring our own wine several times since the servers did not seem to notice our empty glasses despite how many times they walked by. Unacceptable. The waitstaff was nice but very inattentive to us even though the restaurant was not that busy and we were seated next to the hosts stand. This was another annoyance in itself. Upon arriving we were seated at the table right next to the host stand and entrance - in other words, the worst table in the house. It had no atmosphere and it barely even felt like we were dining in the restaurant. Considering it was 7:45 and the restaurant was less than half full, we requested a different table but were told \"they were completely booked\". By the end of our meal, the restaurant had only became more empty, and there were PLENTY of open tables, so this was quite annoying. Our experience was so disappointing overall we skipped desert and opted to leave early. For a Michelin-Starred restaurant, they have A LOT of areas to be improved.","225":"A nice dinner in a nice restaurant with really nice n helpful service. The ambiance is nice, the Chinese foods they're serving is Cantonese but judging from the rice soup with pork that they served, I think it's more to Hokkien style porridge. But, I'm no expert to the Chinese food. The cod fish with vegetables and pumpkin soup also very nice. We tried the lobster soup which also very nice. Portions were small and just enough for one person. Price wise this restaurant is moderate. Some food's selection can be very expensive too. Next time I'll try their lunch :-)","226":"The location of one of our more recent Yelp brunches, Cherry Garden was in truth, a little disappointing.I've been here for dinner, and one thing that is really top-notch is the service. They really commit to delivering excellent service and deserve due recognition.I enjoyed dinner more than the brunch buffet, mainly because the star of the buffet, the dim sum, was more lose-sum than win-sum.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of variety, and some very unique selections. The custard bun with chocolate was to me, just delicious. Not too sweet, super rich chocolate filling that other people at the table made rather unflattering analogies with, I was more than happy to eat two.The cooked items such as the pork, duck, and other seafood items and meat were definitely of an excellent standard, and probably stole the show. It's only a pity that there's a limit on how many of certain items you can order because they cost more.The soups were... alright. I wouldn't describe them as bland, but they weren't any better than something you'd order at Soup Restaurant. Overall, while the value for the buffet brunch is undeniable (particularly if you're a bottomless pit comme moi), but I think the quality of the dinner menu is far superior. A good compromise? Go for the buffet, but aim for the cooked items. That's where all the delicious lurks.","227":"Why does Singapore work for gluttons like me? Oh yeah, the endless buffets. It's only fitting I post a SG review for a Chinese buffet... it harkens back to the good ole days of yore, when I willingly posted about my piggy-ventures on the east coast. But the difference lies in the standards of this a la carte buffet of Cherry Garden. This place is good. And by good, I mean goooooooood. Order as many of those little juicy bite-size delicacies of dim sum as you want, and it arrives steaming hot ready to be scooped up and chomped on. Shrimp fillings are surprisingly plump and springy, and the dumpling skin is not too thick (okay, not super thin, but willing to overlook this small fact). If an overload of dumplings isn't enough to satisfy your weekend hangover, top it up with a choice of soup, meat, fish and vegetable dishes-- and even dessert! (I recommend the refreshing watermelon aloe dessert in all its liquid nitrogen foggy goodness). Does this food far exceed any Chinese buffet I've ever experienced back home? Um, yes.The price is only marginally more than you would pay for any normal dim sum excursion, so is it worth it? Um, yes. Have I gone more times than I can possibly admit on a public forum and not seem ridiculous? Um, yes.","228":"I spent two years in Hong Kong so yes I'm picky about my dim sum. And I've also always been incredibly disappointed with the dim sum offerings in Singapore. Even back home in Melbourne there were better options than here.Cherry Garden is the one exception. I will admit that I feel as if the standard has dropped a little since I first came here. But it's still the best dim sum I've ever had in Singapore.Their dim sum brunch deal is good value for all you can eat. There are a few mis-steps, eg. the skin on the har gau is too thick, the fried tentacles are bland and the hot & sour soup also lacks punch.But there are also a lot of hits. The char siu bao is very well executed, the loh bak guo is in the Singapore hawker style rather than the Cantonese dim sum style but tastes excellent, and I highly recommend the wasabi mayo prawns.Service is professional and polite and the restaurant is a fairly comfortable one to sit in.","229":"Our experience at Cherry Garden was a polished one from beginning to end. It was a little on the pricey end but we did eat a number of delicacies and receive impeccable service. Their ability to adapt their traditional dishes to be gluten free was done with a can-do attitude and at the end of the night our waiter came over and gave me a fresh long stemmed rose to keep. A sweet gesture that brightened up our hotel room for the duration of our stay.","230":"Maybe my expectations for this place was too high. I went with my taiwanese friends who were in town, and they wanted to go due to high reviews on trip advisor. The general consensus was a \"meh\". Sure, it's a buffet, for a relatively affordable price, but the items are, in my humble opinion, not as tasty as say Imperial Treasures or Crystal Jade dining in. It was oooookay, but nothing blew me away. The soups were a little bland, and the various dumplings were somewhat well, buffet standard. Definitely not coming back.","231":"Love love love it. But haven't been since they stopped the champagne brunch where we were regulars. But I do plan to go back soon just for the food as the food is utterly amazing. I would say that compared to Yan Ting, Cherry Garden has huge highs but some lows, whereas Yan Ting lacks the highs, but is consistently very good across the board for all items. I don't know about you, but for free flow dim sum, you can stick to the amazing items. I still dream about the gyoza and the crystal mushroom\/courgette dumplings, and the drunken sesame chicken. Awesome! And don't forget the chocolate ball desserts, oh my.... I could eat those all day. And my friends all loved the mango dessert. Check out my blog for more info! Here is one of my posts:mylifeinsin.com\/2012\/11\/\u0085And heremylifeinsin.com\/2012\/12\/\u0085","232":"The chance is here! And this time round I was here on a weekday morning in Toa Payoh for a plate of so called one of the best carrot cake in Singapore. In the past I was there in the evening and was rather disappointed as by the time I was there, Chey Sua Carrot Cake Stall was already closed for the business day.There was no queue in front of the stall which caught me by surprised and immediately i went up and order a medium portion at $3 but was asked for a table number. They provide the service to your table and no wonder there was no queue to be seen.They are one of the few carrot cakes stall left that insist in preparing their own carrot cake from the scratch instead of adopting the factory packed carrot cake. And if you are looking for traditional taste like this, Chey Sua Carrot Cake may suits the list.Carrot Cake - $3 (Medium)Though most of the Carrot Cake comes in white or Black version, for Chey Sua, their default will be white. I was absolutely surprise when the lady took my order over. Carrot cake was fried to crisp and you can see the distinctively layer and amount of eggs used. The combination of crispiness and softness of their carrot cake was heavenly. Not forgetting about the consistent use of chai bor that had been mixed with the carrot cake, elevating its taste. Unlike the usual carrot cakes we had in rectangular and cube shapes, theirs remind me of Korean Kimchi Pancake.Spelling another difference in their carrot cake will be the style of chilli used. If you realised, chilli was only a final touchup on the exterior crisp layer. The uniqueness of Chey Sua Carrot Cake had really won my heart! I don't mind travelling here in the morning for a plate of this again!","233":"Carrot cake was the first Singaporean dish that really stunned me. A 45 minute wait (1300 on a Saturday) for Bib Gourmand carrot cake seemed like a good deal.It was pretty good - not too dry and sufficiently spicy. One of the best carrot cakes I've had in Singapore. But not unequivocally the best. Probably not worth the wait (or travel) to this part of Singapore - but if you're here anyway, you might as well.","234":"I'm not very sure if I'm particularly overwhelmed by this carrot cake. There's quite a bit of hype over it and when my nomming friend mentioned that you had to wait in excess of 30mins for this dish - I was kind of expecting something a lot more, flavourful. So, wait we did - and my friend who lives around the area has been to this hawker centre multiple times but only had this carrot cake once because of the extremely long wait time, that I guess is a deterrent to some. As we waited, we ordered other dishes and the friend shared that, it's really up to the stall owners when you're going to get your carrot cake and that a lot of people give up after a while. So when the carrot cake came, I really was expecting something yummy for all that hype and wait that you have to go through. But, it really disappointed. The only thing that I liked about it was the crispy eggy top - which was its saving grace. I wasn't too excited about the flour kuehs below because it was really too salty and chopped up. I'm more a fan of carrot cake that has rice kuehs that you can bit into and have that smokey wok hei flavor just burst in your mouth. Overall, I wouldn't wait for this carrot cake again. There are a lot of other yummy dishes in this hawker centre that you should try.","235":"It is getting quite hard to find a sinfully delicious fried carrot cake. My favorite stall used to be from the market somewhere in Ang Mo Kio where it was fried by a very old auntie (probably in her 70s) in the 2000s. The kueh (steamed carrot cake) was homemade and was the same for the chwee kueh also sold in the stall. It was wobbly soft and could just melt in your mouth. I have yet to taste something similar ever since. The kueh in most fried carrot cake was firm or hard, like days old kueh. It just was not satisfying.Chey Sua Carrot Cake almost got the wobbly soft texture. What I like about it was the crispy eggy part which covered the soft kueh underneath. The chili was even distributed and fried together. I really dislike those places where the chili was served on the side. The wait was long, maybe 30 minutes or more, during lunch time. And it was sold out by 2pm that day. Go early and order. While waiting for it, order something else to tide you over, and the carrot cake can be a snack to share when it arrives. It is one of the better ones around in the island.","236":"the life of a hawker must be a thankless job.if your food is good, many people will flood your stall then they will curse as they have to wait long long.if you rush to meet their insatiable demands, your standards might drop and the queue vanishes.so......to be or not to be........here at chey sua, they are the king or queen.i might be the duke and baron but wait i still must.btw you only get to wait if they are not closed.at liberty they open when they want, here they close as and when they want.so don't check in until you climb up those stairs and double confirmed that they are indeed open!even if they are indeed open, do not check in until you know for sure that they have not run out of carrot cake.even if they indeed have not run out of carrot cake, do not check in until you know the estimated waiting time!deceptively, there might not be a queue standing in line but trust me, it is a trap.everyone seating around the stall is in the queue ahead of you!!!so, if you so happen to still insist on checking in here be prepared to wait in excess of 45 mins on a weekend or holiday.your best bet for a check in and dukedom might well be an early weekday morning.and please do not approach the aunty or uncle frying!!!hawkers at work must not be disturbed.go to the right hand side of the stall where the ordering takes place.first words that always comes out of their mouth: MUST WAIT HOR! normal response would be: how long?Booooooom comes the answer: VERY LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!ok, how long is very long?MORE THAN #@$@#@%%@^&!&!()!!!!!!!ok can.if you survive that, please do not ask or order the black version!!!there is no black version here!!!!never was and never will be.an uncle tried to be funny and ordered black and insisted that they do sell the black version!????kenna he did from them!black and black face thereafter.of course i absorbed all these whilst waiting for my one order for takeaway.and mind you, that is after i finished my come daily hokkien mee for breakfast.so why is the queue so long?the process is complicated.the 'cake' has to be fried just right to be crispy on the outside and melt on the inside.the prep starts at the rear of the stall where another cuts the 'cake' into small cubes.a quick fry in tonnes of oil and the hot 'cake' is scooped into a bowl of well beaten eggs to coat with cholesterol before being returned to the pan for more torture.in goes the chye por and the crisping process starts.once crisped, it is dished or packed and the token chopped spring onions adorned.oh wait, that is not mine!sigh.......the uncle ahead ordered gazillion packets to go!!!!!sob............i sat quietly waiting, as many who ventured forward to ask about their order were shot.so after a 45 mins wait........i rushed home in a cab with my bounty as i was running late.you see, i actually ran to chey sua.anyways, the bottom line is it is crisp.even though mine was a takeaway packet.they do indeed put in a lot of hard work to make it so.and yes, it is a thankless job of splattering hot oil and intense heat.","237":"There are many good carrot cake stalls in Singapore. Personally, I've always preferred the white carrot cake. And one of my favourite stall is in Toa Payoh where I grew up. Similar to Come Daily Hokkien Mee at the same food centre, I have practically grew up with both stalls. And over the years, I also watched the older generation pass the baton on to their younger generation. Fortunately, standards have not dropped one bit.A good carrot cake to me is a combination of fresh home made carrot cake, eggs and chye poh (pickled radish). Like any other good stall, Chey Sua still makes their own carrot cake. You can see them being portioned out of small aluminium bowls which they have been using since they first opened. What I particularly like about their carrot cake is one side is fried practically to a crisp while the other side is only lightly fried. So what you get is a crispy surface and white carrot cake all the way through. The portion of eggs is generous and the chye poh is just right, not too salty. And of course the chilli is just nice too, not too overpowering or oily. They are opened from 6am till 1pm everyday except on Mondays. Perfect for a weekend breakfast.","238":"Read from iEiSiP that this stall's history is at least 40 years old.First impression was that their dish is flatter than other carrot cakes; almost like a crepe.It's crispy on the topside and soft below. The chilli is quite sweet. It's also evident that every ingredient is self-made - something I really appreciate.Overall, I wasn't too overwhelmed despite this stall's popularity.","239":"This is my go-to place for duck rice in Singapore. \u00a0There's usually a queue for it (and closed on Mondays, I think) but it does move pretty quickly. I usually get the small set (comes with some cucumber, hard boiled egg, duck meat and rice), which is quite filling and a bargain at S$3. \u00a0The set does not come with a lot of duck meat, but the duck meat is lean and tender and the rice is flavorful. \u00a0If you want to get a larger portion of meat, you can just get the regular duck rice (not the set). \u00a0So. Good.","240":"Food hunt in Chong Pang area and this is a popular stall my friend recommended me. Chuan Kee's braised duck rice is definitely very well done. I like the lean meat and sauce combination from Chuan Kee. The sauce isn't overly sweet and the lean meat is tender. Add to that, their service is relatively fast, so the queue \u00a0moves fast as well. Price wise, it starts from $2.50 for a simple plate of duck rice. I tried their standard duck rice and I gotta say I like it over many other duck rice stalls in Singapore. They definitely aren't the average joe duck rice stalls. The rice is pretty well done too, but the best was still the lean duck meat. The chili sauce was so-so, not a big factor that makes them popular. What I would suggest is to ask to get additional duck meat to go with the rice, because that's what I really like about their braised duck. It is not oily as well, so it's not that sinful.","241":"There are lines at this famous hawker stall at Golden Mile, but it goes quickly. Why the line? Well, it's one of the only stalls in Golden Mile with Laksa and the prawn mee has earned this place a Michelin \u00a0Star. At $5 the Laksa was very good: spicy, fishy, with a great coconut broth. However, it was not mind-blowing as you'd expect a Michelin Stared place would be.","242":"Very good soup. Chilli version is nice but not spicy enough (even with lots of Chilli). I guess because they also sell laksa and Chilli mee, the ingredients they give is the same of all types of noodles, just with different soup or gravy. Of all the ingredients they pump into your bowl, I love their soft ribs ingredient most!!","243":"This noodle stall has been at the current location since the 80s. Other stalls comes and goes at the hawkers center but this stall is still running.The two signature noodle dish here are the prawn noodle and the chilli noodle. The prawn noodle is not the big prawn type, so pricing is very reasonable. The other signature dish is the chilli noodle and this seems to be the famous of the two. The prawn noodle comes in a large bowl of soup and with prawn and \u00a0pork ribs. The soup has a slight herbal taste but does not over power the prawn taste. It also comes with sliced fish cakes.The Chilli noodle comes in a special spicy chilli sauce, pork ribs, prawns, sliced fish cake, dried bean curd and slices of hard boiled egg. For those who love chilli, this noodle is fantastic. But beware it is very spicy.Both are very good. If I were to choose one it would have to be the Chilli noodle.The auntie taking the orders was friendly. The noodle is freshly prepared but comes very fast.","244":"Chung Cheng was introduced by my friend who lives near Army Market. I decided to trust my friend since he knows where to find good food around his area. The first thought that came into my mind was Chili Mee?! What is Chili Mee? Never heard of that before.But after seeing the long queue, I knew my friend did not lie to me. Definitely it must be something special. Interesting! The noodles is mixed with lots of chili paste. The chili has a combination of sweetness and spiciness. Totally WOW!Plus they serve really awesome soup that comes with it. This is something which everyone should try. Really unique and nice.","245":"Don't be distracted by the numerous articles about where to find the best Hokkien mee, take it from me instead, a Hokkien mee affectionado since I was a kid, this one is the best, ever. Some like it wet, some like it dry. I'm the former. And growing up, I always preferred the Cuppage Centre version. Many have tried to convert me to the dryer type, even my own mother! Sorry even Old Airport Road cannot compare. Not even close. And amongst the wetter saucy version this is definitely the best. I was first taken to this place as a late teen, being sent to queue in the old original market when it was still single storey and derelict looking. Then, they used to wrap the tapow in orpey leaf. Man, was it good! I've never looked back since that first time, there's never been another, never will. Like I say, this is the best Hokkien mee. Ever. I am not going to describe the dish for you, there is no need to. Just go try it. Not anywhere, but here at Tian Tian Lai Hokkien Mee. Tell me if you don't agree. Tell me if you do.","246":"Came here for lunch after reading good reviews here but alas... Not up to standard as it's not fragrant enough, prawn also considered small.After meal, still not shiok... First and last for me.After all these years, the best still goes to Swee Guan Hokkien Mee in Geylang.","247":"This must be my favorite Fried Hokkien Mee in Singapore. It has been extremely hard to find really delicious noodles now, what with so many hawkers retiring and food court versions being generic. This is a calorie laden dish with each strand of noodle (mee and bee hoon) being coated with the addictive rich lardy sauce. There I said it. Lard. The lard made all the difference. Besides a few pieces of lard being served with the noodles, the whole dish has the taste of lard and prawn. It has been at least a year or more since I last went there and the standard is still good. Price seemed to have increased, but for the $4 plate (small), it seemed to be more than before. What I found is that while it is really yummy, too much of a good thing can be bad for you. Literally. It does get a bit \"jelak\" (so rich you get sick of it) after a while. So either just have a small portion or share the bigger plate.","248":"It is yummy but the weekend line can kill you. Call ahead to book a packet and save yourself the agony of waiting!The style here is more wet and gooey, served up with more bee Hoon than yellow noodles. Lots of hidden pork lard pieces too!","249":"come daily come, daily, daily come, comecome daily come, daily, daily come, comewell, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me someyou gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me somesome \"come daily fried hokkien prawn mee\" that is!your doctor will probably not recommend that you come daily, not unless he eats, he shoots, he posts.so why trudge all the way to toa payoh for this?how about the flavourful crustacean stock that coats every single sliver of intense wok hei fried noodles in a gooey binding mix?how about the generous artery clogging crispy crunchy pork lard and belly that reminds you just how lucky you are that your food orientation does not exclude pig farms?how about being able to enjoy this simple yet iconic dish early in the morning without any queue?how about the ever friendly aunty who serves you with a smile no matter how busy they get?the small tiny pieces of prawn and squid hence becomes an unwanted distraction but perhaps also a detraction.they will easily achieve the fifth star should their prawn and squid choose to grow commensurately.yes, do try to come daily but ironically you can only do so 6 out of 7 days a week.","250":"To me, this is the best Fried Hokkien Mee stall in Singapore, bar none. They have been around since the early 70s. Back then, they were in located along Toa Payoh Lorong 1 in a small row of food shophouses facing the road. You could always see the snaking lunch crowds and dinner queues. \u00a0When the nearby wet market was redeveloped and the shophouses torn down, their stall moved to the 2nd level food centre above the new market. Fortunately, their standards have remained high despite the generations. And the snaking queues remain.Theirs is the wet and gooey version of this perennial hawker favourite. I feel it brings out the full flavor of the stock, the prawns, the squids, the pork bellies, and of course the noodles. It is also one of the few stalls I have been lucky enough to enjoy since I was a wee lad. And hopefully, for many many more years to come.","251":"We came to Corner House for dinner on our second night in town. The restaurant itself is within Singapore Botanical Gardens, but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting, there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to Corner House without much trouble. Once there, you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area. There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself. One of the standouts for sure, alongside the decor, is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular - it has the feeling of a high-end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing (thanks to the temperature here, no one shows up in the more formal dress I would expect to see at a European or American Michelin-starred restaurant), but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident. Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good. As for service, I found it a bit more attentive than Candlenut (from the previous night), but in a similar fashion, it was not overly personalized either.In a similar vein, what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got - no deviation or extra surprises along the way. While there are other menu options if you don't come over the weekend, you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise (we were there Sunday). You get 9 courses, but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours, so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than I was expecting to have. That said, I felt that every dish was very strong as a result - it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible. The amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion - our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble. My favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented, which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime-infused broth - simple and refreshing. We moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared. The scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice, and combined with the yuzu, was fresh, and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta - making it a bit of an Italian-inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce. The white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal - the only vegetarian course outside of dessert - but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective. The highlight was definitely the blue cod, which was served with the scales of the skin crisped, mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin...definitely one of the most beautiful-looking fish dishes I have eaten (and gorgeously presented to boot). The wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate, but it was quite delicious (although it could have been cooked a tad more - the middle was too rare for my liking). We finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of French strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser \/ first dessert, followed by a chocolate mousse served with Earl Grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates - probably the heaviest dish of evening, but a nice way to end the meal sated.Corner House is a more Western-oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast Asian cuisine, but even if you have limited time here, it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot. To me, it feels like an appropriate representation of what Singapore has become, and it's worth making the trek out from the city center (about a 15-20 minute drive) to dine here.","252":"A huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Impeccable service - my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four.The Salted Egg Macaroons. My god. These might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. They melt on your tongue, leaving a cacophony of flavour. If there's a peak for Singapore's salted egg obsession, this is it.But truth be told - the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting. The asparagus was quite plain. The gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours. The crispy cod, though, was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting. The venue is beautiful, and the service impeccable. Even if dinner (plus three house wines between four) cost a hefty $400 sgd, it was an evening to remember.","253":"I was taken here for a belated birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is situated in the Botanic Gardens, and you may want to look up on how to get there, because the garden is quite... large. I find the food here generally technically competent, with flavor pairings quite fresh, and a fusion of French and a teensy bit of Modsin, which I really enjoy. The Modsin here doesn't go too far, and instead teases the diner here and there.I had the:Amuse bouche, prawn cracker and oyster leafNothing to shout about, nice and crunchyCarabinero prawn with tomatoesI would have loved to eat this with a local prawn, but carabinero works too. Red on red, went very well.Foie gras MousseI loved the petal garnish, but also well-executed, nothing extraordinary.Cod with crispy scalesThis, I loved. I have not eaten such crispy scales, with no hint of oil, and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce. Also, very aesthetically pleasing.WagyuWell-executed, with a delicious onion... thing. My friend doesn't eat beef so they swapped it out with pork.Durian bread and butter puddingI felt the durian could have been stronger, but overall, very tasty, and sweet.Petit foursSalted egg macarons were yum, though the salted egg could have been heavier. Chocs were, well, good.I love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food, and its modsin influence. I do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring. The food here is really technically competent, but could utilize more local produce. Love!","254":"Went for a lunch with some friends and the experience was lovely. Service staff was patient with our table of 6. Food was delicious and plenty to fill us up. Particularly love the concept of sharing appetizers so we could try a few different dishes.","255":"Short review: gourmet hawker center. Long review:Food is creative but not exhilarating. Ambiance is typical and very short of special. Hype is overwhelming with Michelin accolades and table scarcity. You can spend $300pp much more wisely than eating here. Biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast (no photo pictures because of this), lack of intimacy (group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding, which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner), overall casual atmosphere (T-shirt's and crocs allowed).I would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center. Don't \u00a0bother dressing nicely, because you will certainly be overdressed. With that in mind, this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion. Instead, go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you're keen on dropping $300-400 per person.","256":"The entire experience at Corner House really deserves 4.5 stars but because of the amazing food, they got bumped up to 5.We had the Discovery Menu, and highly recommend it. The onion prepared four ways remains one of the most memorable dishes we have had to date.All waitstaff professional and friendly, we met the Chef who is such a humble guy. A really wonderful restaurant all round, we'll be sure to be back again and again","257":"Super nice environment in the middle of the magnificent Singapore Botanical Garden. Very excellent food. Courteous professional service.The day we were there even the \"suitcase\" chef owner was there and was very pleasant.","258":"Truly deserves the Michelin Star!!Had gone there for their business lunch, 3 course menu. I think that's the most value for money way to try out the place. Its in an excellent location in the botanical gardens. Their food is a work of art!I had the foie grais, toothfish and the chef's interpretation of kaya toast. Everything was spectacular and amazing in taste. Highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to treat yourself to a great meal!","259":"Totally a restaurant that caught me off guard - one that I saved towards the end of my SG upper tier restaurant binge. Highly recommended in every regard - setting, service, food, and creativity. My girlfriend and I made a Sunday dinner reservation where, quite frankly, I was expecting a typical French fusion restaurant that I see all over NYC, London, etc but there has to be a reason that it is Top 50 in Asia (even though the list is totally hit or miss). We arrived at the drop off location (after a short period of getting lost - Make sure you go to the Nassim Gate location which is at Nassim Road and Cluny Road. Google Maps took us to the other side of the Botanic Gardens at Corner House Gate which is the service entrance), pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant.We sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu. We opted for the dinner Discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned 8 course experience (see image). Afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely French heavy and what I thought was a very expensive list. We did a nice bottle of Hermitage.I LOVE restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot. Every menu option was just...WOW. Not a single course that wasn't to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each. The specific items that blew my mind were the \"Interpretation of my favorite vegetables\" which was a few different snacks using onion, each of which were surprisingly fantastic. Would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing? IT WAS!! Or onion with truffle or dried onion slices? SO GOOD!! Also was the \"Chef Jason's botanica\" which was simply an art piece. Should be in a museum somewhere. Lastly was his \"My favorite childhood food memory\" dessert with meringue crackers, homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread - which was totally out of this world. Anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking, I get happy.Service was impeccable. The waiters were all very kind and friendly, not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber. To add the final touch of perfection, Jason Tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit. Easily part of the top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Asia. Highly recommend if on a date with someone special (you are in the Singapore Botanic Gardens after all), a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together!","260":"Fabulous food, one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. Great flavours and combinations. Service was excellent, in total contrast to some other local establishments (*cough* NeonPigeon). The brevity of this review doesn't do the place justice - just go. And make sure you order the melt-in-your-mouth beef.","261":"i want to come back in this place. - Kyla Pangcoga","262":"I'm so fond of this restaurant and it's got so much to do with the exceptional service they offered during our anniversary dinner. My heel broke as I was getting out of the taxi and I carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so I could perform surgery on my shoe. The hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat. She fixed it in 5 minutes so I could climb the stairs to our table. She was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary. I'm so thankful for her!Now to what I know most of you care about shoe repair--food! The menu was rather concise. They offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for $248 per person or a more limited menu for $98 per person that included fewer items. We started with a wonderful bottle of Riesling for $100.Please see my photos for more information on our meal, which was absolutely delightful. Everything was prepared perfectly. The textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal. This place is great for a special occasion, anniversary or birthday. It's not very Paleo-friendly, but it's definitely worth the cheat!","263":"Reminded me of Per Se in NYC for the oyster omelette, Narisawa & L'Effervescence in Tokyo for the nitrogen dessert & signature onion dish respectively, fused with a unique Singapore style. Great wine list. Highly recommend the Discovery Menu for an interesting gastronomical adventure...","264":"not to be mistaken for chubby hubby is chef jason tan, helming a once historic and now culinary house that has seen the likes of au jardin les amis.the team under him, though a little unpolished, will certainly shine in due course.sophia, hope i got her name right, deserves special mention for her impeccable service.the one thing that you should never pass on here, has to be the breads! the walnut bread, classic french baguette and if you are lucky, his version of ham chee peng were all BRILLIANT.whoever the bakery genius is behind those delicately delicious dough deserves a pay rise immediately!but do limit yourself to only one serving of each and save room for the gastronomical journey that awaits.after your sinful carbo loading jump start comes a plethora of amuse bouche, that is if you are having the discovery menu, that will further convince you that you have come to the right house!the play on taste, colour and texture awakens and heightens your senses in preparation for the courses that follow. the highlights from the discovery menu has to be chef jason's 'botanica', a curation of botanicals in a variety of preparations.it is like fifty shades of vegetables in different doneness, acidity, hue and texture.you will never look at a vegetarian dish in the same way again after consuming this artistically assembled selection of fibrous produce.and just when you thought you have seen it all, another humble vegetable, a favourite of jason's is presented for you to eat in 4 ways!the oignon doux des c\u00e9vennes interpreted and transformed into a confit on crispy filo pastry, a dehydrated thinly sliced onion, a whole baked onion with sous vide egg and truffle and finally as an emulsion with earl grey infused onion tea.hey, this man knows, likes his vegetables and you will too!all before led me to the highest crescendo but alas two of three subsequent dishes, that i will single out, send me crashing rock bottom.the cod with crispy scales was overcooked, cold and bland.the bresse pigeon was by far the worst dish of the night!superlatively gamey and way bloodily undercooked!the accompanying foie gras was obviously of the duck variety and tasted as such, quite unpalatable.is this becoming like a roller coaster ride? can his desserts save him?the answer is a resounding yes!especially memorable were the salted egg macaron and the jackfruit mochi.jason is definitely creative and these happy endings led me to give corner house a second chance.and that second chance came in the form of citibank's $100 gourmet with swedish guest chef niklas ekstedt.redemption time?yes!the pacing could have been a little better but somewhat understandable as they were running at full house.am not sure if chef niklas upped jason's game but no fowl play today, hooray!this time around, jason's free range chicken dish was licked cleaned and a five star upgrade from the inedible bresse pigeon dish that bombed so badly in the mouth.his other solo effort was the scallop dish and again it showed that the overcooked cod might have been just a one off letdown.having said that, consistency is of the essence when it comes to dishing out michelin stars.and the fifth from me will be awarded when consistency is achieved.","265":"this was me and justin b's fancy dinner while on our trip to Singapore and it did not disappoint! first off, the location is awesome within the botanical gardens so its really pretty and tranquil but note that i do not recommend taking the LRT to get here because once you exit the station, its a long walk to the restaurant through the gardens and in the Singapore heat\/humidity, its not that fun haha. after walking to work up an appetite for dinner haha...the restaurant itself is so cute! its just like a house with cool modern-ish decor. making reservations online was easy and no problem in getting availability about 2 weeks in advance. we were seated on the 2nd floor window table which overlooked the gardens for a nice atmosphere. service throughout the meal was outstanding too! as justin b. noticed, you know that you're in a nice restaurant when its the kind of place that folds your napkin for you when you get up to use the restroom haha. everyone was so attentive to our needs and each dish was explained to us in detail that we definitely felt taken care of! i mean after our meal we decided to taxi instead of walk back to the LRT so they called a cab for us and drove us in a golf cart down to the gate so that we didnt have to walk more!as for the meal itself, we both opted to go all out and ordered the Discovery Menu and the wine pairings to go with it haha...every dish was a visual masterpiece! the presentation was so beautiful and some dishes like the vegetable garden which had some like 40+ ingredients in it was almost too pretty to eat haha. the taste of the food was actually really good too though haha...while every dish didnt wow me, they were all good and tasty - the pork jowl, beef, and cocoa pebble dessert were my faves though and they send you home with a tin of madeline cookies that were really good. the wine pairing turned out really well for us too - very generous pours and it was practically a diff wine with each dish so i felt that was worthwhile to do. just the overall price point about ~$300 USD per person and i wasnt overwhelmingly impressed with each dish holds me back from the full 5-star rating...but if you want a nice fancy dinner in singapore, i would still recommend Corner House!","266":"Possibly the best meal I've ever had, we did the 'Lunch Discovery Menu' for $128\/person. \u00a0The artistry that went into each dish was superb. \u00a0Being a more 'average joe' when it comes to cuisine, I was timid about coming to a restaurant like this, expecting it to be outside my realm of appreciation. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised that even though each dish looked like it was created simply for appearance, it was backed up by some of the best tasting food I've ever had and each item being very different from the last. \u00a0My favorite has to be the pork and even as not a big seafood eater, the seafood dishes were amazing.To cap it off, the service is impeccable and the ambiance of the botanical gardens in an old black and white was sublime. \u00a0With a bottle of wine, we broke the $500 mark between the two of us so not something for an average day out but a wonderful place for a special occasion.","267":"The 2-storey restaurant sets the mood for \"exquisite eating\" which I didn't hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness. Instead, fine-dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal.The lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top-up if you want a Riso pasta or a Kaya Toast as dessert. A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour. We were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs. We were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served. That's the whole service I give honor to as I care extensively about what I eat and how they flavored my dining exposure.They came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out. I was look forward to the small heap of Yves Bordier French butter - very rich and creamy. Like we did, sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon app\u00e9tit!We were presented with the Marinated Norwegian Salmon Trout for a start. I am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat. Nevertheless, the teaser wasn't a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions, celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth. The salmon is nice without a fishy note, very nicely cured.I had the free range chicken instead of the Riso Pasta (supplement of $8), the latter reminds me of Orzo pasta which I once had at The Waterfall Cafe and am still liking it. I didn't want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me. The Free Range Chicken has a very fine texture, baby tender like a juvenile. The skin is lightly pan-seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out. Jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness. The foam like I guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate.I tasted the impressive \"The interpretation of Kaya Toast\" (supplement of $8) and was feeling complete! The taste of Gula Melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding. I love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar, mirroring the chendol we once knew. The muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet - heavenly match.Alternatively, you may choose to go with the Soursoup Sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast. It has a smooth texture with a robust Soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication. Not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of Morello cherry compote. The pretty-looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction. It gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal. However if you adore a loud booming ending, go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me.Oh they have free buggy service, ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden.Bon appetit, yelpers!!!","268":"The corner house restaurant is a converted bungalow in the botanical gardens. As such its location Is quaint and very beautiful. Service is attentive and very professional. The food is excellent. Each course was sublime, carefully prepared and presented as a piece of art. As expected its pricy. Perfect for that special occasion. Very romantic. A great place for couples to pop the question. The chicken was one of their signature dishes. Deceptively simple but the breast was brined and sous verde. The cooking and preparation method ensured that it was tender and succulent with the brine intensifying the flavor. The dark meat was brined and pan fried. 2 methods, very different and went well in contrast.","269":"It was a little difficult to find the spot but once you are seated in the balcony area surrounded with all the green trees,you will know the walk is worth. And the food is surprisingly good. We had the lunch set. Must pay a little extra for the chocolate tart! It's rich and smooth and a little hidden crunchy inside!","270":"I was a big fan of Au Jardin les Amis that used to occupy the same premises, so I really wanted to check out the new restauranteur. Came for lunch with 2 friends. We all ordered the four course lunch menu ($58++ per person), which came with a choice of 2 appetizers. Food proved excellent - good variety of flavors and combination of tastes - and met my expectations based on my experience with Au Jardin. The style is listed as \"modern European\" on this website, but the waiter pointed out local influences, so it was more like contemporary fusion. The pork jowl was exceptional. The only thing that might do with improvement was what seemed to me the overuse of mousse-type sauces and creams. As for service, a couple of the wait staff were excellent but a couple of others looked grumpy (one made eye contact with me several times and just stared with no hint of a smile). I also had to ask for my water glass to be refilled midway through the meal. No one asked if we'd like coffee\/tea afterwards. Unfortunate that the service overall did not match the outstanding food.","271":"My foodie friend from Singapore recommended this restaurant for lunch since we were going to the Botanical Gardens (the restaurant overlooks the gardens!) . \u00a0I checked the reviews, which were amazing. \u00a0We were very pleased with the meal. Both of us had the tempura soft shelled crab which was beautifully \u00a0cooked and presented. The cod was perfectly cooked (extremely fresh and moist). \u00a0My braised beef cheek was so tender it was almost unnecessary to have a knife, and was delicious. Desserts were both excellent. \u00a0One of the best lunches we have ever had. \u00a0Portions are not large but adequate. \u00a0Reviews are correct about the price. Three course for $S 42, but my wife upgraded the entree to Atlantic Cod for$8 and dessert to Kaya Toast for $9. \u00a0I upgraded to braised beef cheeks for $12 and vacherin goma (black and white sesame ice cream) for $5. But still worth the price due to extremely good food and service. \u00a0We met Chef Tan who came to see how we liked the meal. \u00a0He took pictures with us and even showed us his kitchen since I said I am a foodie. Memorable experience overall !","272":"QQ Dumplings: 3.5 starsLooks like an adorable little elephant (???). \u00a0Chewy rice flour ??? dough.Prawn with Mango: 1 starI really didn't like this dish. \u00a0It tasted like that cheap kind of mayonnaise\/cream cheese-based dish at Americanised Chinese restaurants and was too heavy and sweet.Noodle Roll with Salted Egg Yolk: 5 starsThis was amazing. \u00a0It's a cheong fun exterior wrapped around the crispy fried lattice like those that come on taro puffs, and filled with salted egg yolk. \u00a0Dip it in the savoury cheong fun sauce and it blows your mind.Black Bao: 4 starsXiaolongbao (soup dumpling) filling in an exotic-looking steamed bun.","273":"What an amazing experience! Food was perfect and service was also. Pork belly was fabulous and the Peking duct was delicious. Will certainly go back.","274":"Great service, great food. the dim sum dishes we had were really good. to highlight some of them...the salted egg fish skin was really flavorful and crispy. so was the deep friend \"white rice\" fish. The char siew bao were soft and fluffy with great yummy filling on the inside. My favorite is the deep friend minced meat turnover. you don't get that in every dim sum restaurant here in Singapore so I am always very happy to find it on the menu and this particular one was very well made with a crispy exterior and a chewy glutinous interior. Not greasy at all.To avoid disappointment, I highly recommend making a reservation before heading down.","275":"Very nice ambience and excellent food. Meals were served fast, service was good as well.","276":"Crystal Jade- an appropriate name for a restaurant located within a mall that exudes elegance and sophistication. In this establishment you are to experience traditional dim sum perfected and refined to fit a high-class dining experience. I think at least, I've barely eaten anything.As I write this we're about 40 minutes into service and have received only 2 of 8 dishes that we had ordered. They did let us know upon entering that we would only have 1 hour since we didn't have a reservation, which is fine, dim sum barely takes any time at all! Come to find that again, each dish is taking rather long and tables around us are being fed multiple dishes before we've received our 3rd. We've gotten LOADS of tea though, they are very good at pouring and restocking our tea. Which is all we've been doing because there's nothing else to consume on this table.The dishes we did have are fine. They're fine. Worth the 40 minute wait? I'm going to have to reserve judgment since I've yet to taste our remaining 6 items.Our waitress let us know that there were complications in the kitchen, but I find that extremely hard to believe when most other tables have been served many plates of food and we are the only table that has been neglected. The only redeeming factor about this experience is that I ate beforehand. Despite that, this wait is inexcusable and I would exercise caution when dining with Crystal Jade.Update: We've finally received all of our food in exactly 1 hour. I can't imagine that they'd give us grief about staying here longer because we need to eat. My final judgment- it's fine. I can't imagine myself wanting this again or wanting to recommend it to friends. So as there is nothing exceptional being served here, I would only dine here if it is strictly convenient or you are dying of hunger. But even in the latter case you may be forced to wait some time so it may be a lost cause.","277":"Dim Sum LunchBest was the service from Ms Goh Chai Hong who helped me with a bag all the way to the entrance as I was in crutches. So kind of her.Ms Goh also offered my Friend and I shawls if we felt cold.White bait - lovely; light and crispy and not oily - very good.Teochew crystal skin dumplings with chives - good but I don't like the taste of chives, can be a little green.Meatballs - not bad although I am not into meatballsPomfret fillet porridge - goodDried Chilli shrimps on rice rolls - very niceXO sauce carrot cake with egg and bean sprouts - good","278":"Amazing Chinese food! No matter it's the toasted pork, Peking duck or crab egg xiaolongbao, the restaurant did every dish to a perfection. Love the xiaolongbao, the crab yellow was so creamy, and generous in size. It explodes your senses. The hairy crab is a seasonal speciality and only available till mid November. Do not miss out your quota for the year. :) I tried the fried noodle pizza for the first time. The idea is to cut the pizza-like flat thin noodle into small pieces. First spread a thin layer of sugar, and use a spoon to drip a few drops of vinegar. Viola, crispy, slight sweet and sour. I never ate deep fried food, but was tempted to finish almost one slice..Steamed sea bass was also a delicacy. One spoon of fish soup into rice, and eat it with the fish, rich and yet refreshing.The staff was well trained, friendly and very attentive, made all the right recommendations. The restaurant also sells its own branded chili sauce and xo sauce.","279":"This was our second time at Crystal Jade. This time we sat at the bar because we didnt make a reservation but the staff here as usual were super friendly and nice they always make me feel welcome. The bar area was actually quite comfortable. I ordered a few things such as the duck egg fish skin, soup dumplings, custard buns, pork belly and foie gras. However, minutes after there was some kind of alarm and apparently one area of the kitchen had water sprinkler going off and it was the area that made the pork belly and foie gras so were not able to get our dishes. The fish skin was delicious it was light and not too heavy with the egg yolk. The soup dumplings unfortunately all explored and we lost the broth in the dumpling. The custard buns were great!","280":"It's probably best if I didn't tell you how often I was at this restaurant for Sunday dim sum brunch. Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I manage to con different friends to get my dim sum fix at this place week in and week out. Because their dim sum is just.that.damn.good.What's not to love about little pillows of shrimpy\/porky goodness???There's nothing happier to life than baskets of dumplings flowing towards your table to be consumed. Each of this little morsels are crying out EAT ME. So I do. Shrimp dumplings, xiao long bao, teochew crystal dumplings, cute little jumbo shaped dumplings, XO fried carrot cake, shrimp rice rolls, beancurd rolls, etc. etc. You just can't go wrong. Ask for the \u00a0(doubanjiang) for dipping and you're good to go. Because everything tastes better with a little chili kick. -1 star for service because they never seem to get it quite right.","281":"Really like this place for dim sum lunch. \u00a0Great venue, better food, ok service (...even though after the one Michelin star it got way too busy)","282":"It has been a few years since I revisited this place, and I was glad I did. The dimsum still maintained their usual standard, and I just generally find their decor very tasteful, and it is a great place to catch up with friends. I can't think of a single dish that stood out as being outstanding, but the general caliber of the dim sum is pretty damn good. I like the good service here as well, and that it's not too loud compared to other dim sum joints.","283":"Unnecessarily cold: Four stars for food but the temperature of the restaurant make it virtually unsuitable for children and most adults (we brought a three-month old and a toddler). I asked two staff members to see if they could raise the temp but one said it wasn't possible and the other said \"oh we just got the air con serviced so it's much colder now...I can't adjust it\". I'll assume he's speaking factually and CJ should assume I am too when I say we won't be back.","284":"I remember coming here with my cousin, the food was really and the service was good as well. I would recommend coming here if you visit Singapore!","285":"Mixed-menu - this restaurant serves Cantonese and Teochew food. I would recommend the Teochew goose, cold crab, bamboo clams and their daily soup. The pig's stomach soup is also excellent - I highly recommend that - the soup is peppery, and the texture of the stomach is done to a precise consistency - not too soft or tough and very palatable.Great ambience and great food makes this a perfect place for family dinners. The service at this Paragon restaurant is also excellent, I couldn't recommend it enough. The waiters are attentive and professional.","286":"very good chinese food.. ridiculously expensive.. the bbq duck is excellent.. our friends enjoyed their winter melon soup.. cereal prawns are excellent.. service was also quite attentive.. the reason it doesn't score higher is the price.. maybe i'm used to prices in southern california or vancouver where you can also get world class chinese food","287":"Another one of my favorite Teochew restaurant, the other being East Ocean. Great service good food but n the pricier side","288":"For a foreigner this was a great experience. Good authentic Chinese food. Didnt know what I was eating but all goiod.","289":"One of the best steaks I have ever tasted.We went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people, portion wise. It comes with two sauces and 4 different mustards. The steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it. Ordered kale and the patata as sides. The patata was really good as well.Finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert. They were ok but nothing special, wouldn't mind skipping them next time.","290":"One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.Starters are amazing - we ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a whileIf you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationService was really slow and not attentive \/ definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating.","291":"There are few tv celebrity chef restaurants that I've been to that have truly delivered with the menu. \u00a0We stopped in only for drinks (which were divine) and after several drinks we were persuaded to get these mini tuna taco sliders. \u00a0I've had similar dishes at other restaurants (think tuna tartar). These were so good, they had both my boyfriend and I talking about them the following day.","292":"Superb service. You can't expect anything less from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. And it's at the Marina Bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here.Plenty of steaks to choose from. They also make some good cocktails.Again service was great. They kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met. Reservations are recommended although I'm sure they can squeeze you in.","293":"Dined here a few weeks ago. \u00a0Crab cakes, butter lettuce, filet with the apple crumble dessert. \u00a0Enjoyed it very much. Filet was excellently prepared. Would definitely return here next time.","294":"Event Planners - Beware! I am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience. I gave 2 stars because the food and service was good, the management team organizing was not. I felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because I was not onsite to confirm. I was also charged a higher amount on wine as they didn't have the type I chose of which I am still awaiting a refund, from early March. The communication has been slow and not genuine. My concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager.","295":"Mr. Puck is - next to Arnie - one of the more famous and successful Austrian \"exports\". He now ranks amongst the best chefs\/restaurateurs in the world, and \"Spago\" in LA is an institution that has found worldwide fame, now present in many locations, Singapore included. Another venture of his is CUT, focusing on steak. We booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously.As there are many other reviews raving about this place I'm trying to keep it short, hoping to contribute to a coherent picture.Service is very friendly, efficient, and, which I always find refreshing at \"celebrity restaurants\", authentic. No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern\/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab\/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from \"the usual\". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))","296":"I took myself on Valentine's Day after working a long day. For starters, the bread was delish. I preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter. I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate souffl\u00e9. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the souffl\u00e9 arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl\u00e9. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!","297":"I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate souffl\u00e9. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w\/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate souffl\u00e9. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company.","298":"I took my husband here for his birthday while in Singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we've been to. The server was A+ & so was dinner. My favorite was my mocktail (apple, cucumber, & basil).What a great experience? Needless to say, he enjoyed his birthday.","299":"This has got to be the best steak house I have ever experienced. I am formerly of New York City and had my fair share of solid steaks. I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative \"mixology\" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their \"spiked\" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)","300":"Best steaks in town!The Kobe steak is just amazing! I had the filet mignon. The pork belly starter was also really good.","301":"I've been dying to try this place for a while now, finally got to try it last night. Ordered the U.S. filet mignon, UK ribeye, Hokkaido scallop carpaccio, creamed spinach, & wild mushrooms. The cook on the filet mignon was great! The portions were just right for my boyfriend and I. Though we were stuffed at the end of the meal, we couldn't help but try their desserts. The kaya baked Alaska was to die for! It wasn't too sweet, so it was perfect !!Also had the sweet wine & port.","302":"Came here on a pretty amazing, random whim with a great gentleman & his crew while visiting Singapore. My goodness... The presentation & flavor of the drinks & food were AMAZING. And orgasmic. How they made carrots, Mac & cheese, mini Kobe burgers, fish tacos, & potatoes (all separate dishes) taste like culinary heaven is beyond me. The bartender and servers were courteous & lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.","303":"Went here for dinner. I had the Australian porter house. My steak was bland, no flavor, and had a lot of fat not trimmed, and rare was done as medium well. Informed my waiter and she just said she will let manager know.","304":"I really don't have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the LA version, which usually annoys me. \u00a0From what I recall, they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends. We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York. \u00a0D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point. \u00a0On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair. Overall, a place to go in Singapore when you're missing some good quality meat in your life!","305":"This is probably the best steak house in Singapore ! We ordered the wagu grade 8 steak. It literally melt in our mouths ! We started with the tuna tartar. ExcellentThen we had the steak that was shared. \u00a0Heaven Wine was ok , on the expensive side. \u00a0They won't allowed us to bring our own ! \u00a0A bit of a downer We finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl\u00e9. A highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least $200+ per person.","306":"Quite expensive, but truly worth the price I feel. I just loved the mocktail being served here. Streaks are also quite tasty.","307":"CUT is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world, offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from Japan.The menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what I would expect in a West Coast or Las Vegas steakhouse (no surprise)--contemporary, minimalist furnishing and decor. \u00a0Small plates with a modern cuisine flair, like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce. \u00a0The US Angus filet I had was absolutely spot on and delicious.The wine list had a pretty good range in the by-the-glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails--classic and innovative both.Stylistically I prefer the 'old school' New York\/Chicago style steakhouses (this I would not categorize as \"Traditional American Restaurants\")--where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal. \u00a0So while I enjoyed my experience, the match goes to other team--particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it's up against.","308":"Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking...But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost.","309":"The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes.","310":"Beyond being the best steak restaurant in Singapore, CUT won my heart forever when manager Glynn came to my rescue during a whisky and food tasting event that took place early in my pregnancy.As it was just only 2 months into my first trimester at the time, I was still holding off on telling my colleagues, happily ordering mocktails on the sly. \u00a0With high end whisky, the tastings were in small glasses and I pulled manager Glynn aside on my way to the ladies' room to explain my challenge. \u00a0Luckily, Glynn managed to subtly replace my whisky with tea (same color!) and I was unable to enjoy the evening stress-free.The food was exquisite as always. \u00a0My favorites included the bone marrow flan, the blue crab and shrimp \"Louis\", the pork belly, the steak and the pear crumble.PARTING THOUGHT: we're going back to celebrate getting to the second trimester!","311":"The place I go to for my Gin & Tonic fix just cause they make the best one around.As for the steak, I won't say it's out of the world kinda standard but it's decent with a hefty price tagged to it. Besides that, the souffle and the creamed spinach is a must-have when you're there.Regarding the ambiance, I find that the dining area is rather dark and probably due to how the restaurant is layout, the noise\/sound bounces off the wall which kinda make the place really noisy\/loud when people start chitter-chattering the night away (which make it hard to carry conversation properly). However, the bar area is just perfect. To be honest, I rather be sitting at the bar area to have my dinner than the dining area.(Nonetheless, I can't wait to head back there for rounds of G&T already.)","312":"I have not been to one of Wolfgang's CUT restaurants here in the states yet but loved going to business dinners at the one in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands. \u00a0It is meatlovers heaven here. \u00a0Cool comfortable interiors, probably some of the best service in singapore (service isn't that good there generally but is changing). \u00a0American size portions, great cocktails, side dishes, and the desserts! \u00a0The management is american so they hold to their U.S. standard on the aged beef. \u00a0The meat trolly is uncommon in singapore so it was nice to see its appearance here. \u00a0You can't go wrong with CUT but warning it is pricey....have someone treat you there for maximum enjoyment :) \u00a0BTW - DB's, Mozza and Osteria across from it are all also equally great! \u00a0Rumor is that Thomas Keller is coming to Singapore soon at Marina Bay Sands. \u00a0BTW- dress in singapore is one notch down - so where here you would be expected to probably have a jacket on and the ladies dressed to the nines....in singapore it is much more casual which makes the singapore location an even more casual atmosphere for steak house beginners.","313":"Awesomeness !! This review is overdue and I finally found time to write it.I visited the other CUT locations as well and am a regular here at CUT Singapore, in particular the one in Beverly Hills. I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine. This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!Enjoy ~S.","314":"I don't eat steak often, mostly because almost all of my beef experiences in Singapore have been disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised, though, when I was dragged to Cut. I got the USDA New York sirloin with Argentinean Chimichurri sauce, potato puree, and creamed spinach. The sides were exactly what I expected. No surprises there, but archetypes of a high-end steak restaurant. The steak was what surprised me. Perfectly medium-rare, tender, with a smoky, crispy sear. I felt like I was in Chicago. Sure $88++ is not cheap for a 12oz. steak, but considering the market, it's a good deal. I've had some terrible steaks for not a lot less.","315":"The beef steak at cut totally blew my mind. I don't even like steak that much and I never had a craving for steak before. But my experience at cut have changed this! The cocktails were absolutely amazing too. All prepared beautifully, tasted great and packed a nice punch! I would totally come back here just for a drink next time.The down side of this restaurant would be their steep prices but the location, food and drinks here do justify it.","316":"Came here for a birthday dinner and it definitely lived up to expectations and beyond. \u00a0Excellent food, service and ambience. \u00a0We got a private table but was able to people watch in the middle of restaurant. \u00a0A simple menus with steak and steak, plenty of choices on sauces and sides. \u00a0Each staff was perfect in carrying out their services and they were professional to the nth degree.Dessert must try is the apple crumble. \u00a0The s'mores was slightly disappointing. \u00a0Otherwise a very perfect dinner as a dinner date or a party.","317":"The food was AMAZING! \u00a0We loved everything we had there. \u00a0We had salads, soups, filets, and sides...and everything was excellent! \u00a0 Also the bartender, \u00a0Loogie, made me a mix drink that was out of this world! \u00a0It was literally the best drink I have ever had.....it was as big as my head, had an island of ice that had a live flower on top!!! \u00a0I'm in love :)","318":"CUT holds up with the best steakhouses I've been to in the USA, Australia, and Europe. We started our meal with the bone marrow flan. It was fantastic - it was rich and buttery. The garnish went perfectly with the marrow on top of a nice piece of toast. I was impressed. Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house. Overall the meal was pricey, but by comparison to other restaurants in Singapore and taking into account the quality of the food and service, I didn't feel overcharged.","319":"Fantastic food, cocktails and service!We had chips and mini burgers in the lounge area, and two cocktails each, followed up by the chocolate souffl\u00e9. The chips were wonderful, my husband loved the sliders (I didn't try them, since I'm vegetarian) and the cocktails were delicious. The true hero of the meal though was the souffl\u00e9. It was delivered with a flourish and an explanation and it was wonderful.The service from the bar staff was fantastic. They were attentive without being suffocating, and they were good at making suggestions. Highly recommended.","320":"My brother warned me into coming to this restaurant. He went CUT in LA before and he said it was an underwhelming experience. The steaks were too 'modern' and even a bit pretentious. But I still want to try a modern steak house, and I haven't been to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before so curiosity got the best of me.The appetizers were alright. I've tried the oysters, pork belly, warm veal tongue, and they were all very decent.But the steak that I ordered was an extremely huge letdown. I've tried and fell in love with Snake River Farms beef before when I was in the US. Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-The rib eye itself was not that good too. It was too dry, and too chewy and was a great injustice to a Snake River Farms beef.I don't think I'll be back to CUT ever again. There are many better steak houses in Singapore and I'd rather go to Ruth Chris' or even Morton's instead.","321":"OK, I'm a Ruth's Chris and Mastros (SC Plaza) bigot when it comes to steaks, but I gotta say, CUT is now in my top 3 steakhouses. \u00a0 First of all, the service is fantastic. \u00a0Two, the drinks are FANTASTIC -- best dirty martini I've ever had in Singapore. \u00a0Third, my steak and the extra cheesy mac and cheese along with the tuna tartar appetizer were \"lick the plate clean\" good.I also met some of the nicest people the night I ate at the bar - from NYC, Houston and NJ. \u00a0 This place is classy so I recommend business casual attire. \u00a0They also had a great selection of wines and I had a Spanish red wine (can't remember the name) that was \u00a0fantastic.","322":"I-went-back-so-new-review:still utterly fantastic, and wonderfully enjoyable dessert at the marina bay sands. it is understating it to say that this place is now my favorite in singapore - and no, I've not had their steak, and no, I'm not quite planning to. I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle. their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior. we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up. the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here. ----------------------------------------------old review:utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands. I have unashamedly fallen in deep mire with this place - it's now my go-to for indulging in sweets, and I'm afraid that it might just become an uncontrollable habit.I've wanted to come here for a long time - and while I'm bursting with adjectives, let me objectively say that the souffle was high, fluffy, barely deflated even after standing, and when eaten with the chocolate ice cream and creme fraiche on top - was a revelation in deep dark chocolate and that gorgeous play of hot and cold. truly, this ranks as one of the best mouthfuls I've ever had.","323":"Steak in Singapore, why not! \u00a0And why not go to CUT for that consistency that we come to expect from Wolfgang Puck restaurant. \u00a0What a brilliant night at CUT I had last weekend. \u00a0Was traveling solo and had a few meals at local establishments and decided to go visit CUT - this is my third experience at a CUT restaurant (Las Vegas and London being the other two) and I could not find one thing wrong - everything surpassed my expectations. \u00a0From the excellent seating at the bar, to the attention I received from the bartender, the cocktail waitress to the GM himself, the service was over-the-top. \u00a0And the food? \u00a0Amazing appetizers and I did get a chance to try a few of them. \u00a0The Scallops were divine. \u00a0The dirty martini was everything I had heard - my best one at a bar. \u00a0The steak (had the filet) was cooked perfect and would rival any steak you'd get in the US. \u00a0The wine pairing was perfect as was the final cap on the experience - a Singaporean version of baked Alaska. \u00a0They had to roll me out of the restaurant, but at least I had a big smile on my face. \u00a0Lastly, I don't normally cast judgement on others, but I do find it funny that people constantly comment on how pricey restaurants are. \u00a0If you do your homework (and it would not be hard in this case) you'll know the general price for a meal. \u00a0This place is expensive. \u00a0I reserve going to CUT when I'm in the mood to splurge and have a great time. \u00a0I actually don't even look at the price as I know it's going to cost a lot. \u00a0Is it worth it, absolutely! \u00a0Is it for anyone, no! \u00a0Just know that if you are willing to spend it, you will have an excellent night out - I did and have not regretted one visit to CUT.","324":"Very good steak and ambience is nice - a bit dark, but modern and stylish.Dinner is pricey - expect to pay about 150-200 per person when all is said and done. I prefer Morton's to Cut","325":"5-star food at 5-star pricesSingaporeans are passionate about their steaks. It's not uncommon to find $100 steaks on the menus of many high-end restaurants. At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone. Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint. The music's rather loud but we're told it's the way they like it in the States.","326":"a little pricey but simple and straightforward dining. all items are great but I loved the chocolate souffl\u00e9 in particular - really because it's quite hard to find good souffl\u00e9 in Singapore.service is a real performance.","327":"Being a vegetarian, I will admit that I have only ever been to the lounge area at CUT. But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly \"incomplete\" experience, because it is just that good.What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? \"It's not going to be the same..\" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again.","328":"Coming to CUT was definitely a good choice when I went to Singapore, the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. If you want to get steak while your abroad in Singapore, this is the place.","329":"This was dinner for NYE 2014. \u00a0Or is it 2015? \u00a0Either way, the food was expensive. \u00a0We knew what we were getting ourselves into. \u00a0Marina Bay Sands, and what not. \u00a0Suffice to say, no one was disappointed despite the cost. \u00a0My Manhattan had to have been the best damn Manhattan I have ever had. The wine list was extensive and, at the same time, downright ludicrous. \u00a0The lamb with mint sauce was cooked to perfection. \u00a0Ahi tartare was executed properly enough. \u00a0I don't know if this is where I would recommend someone to go in Singapore for a nice meal, but it did the trick. \u00a0They could do without the creepy framed pics of celebrities on the walls. \u00a0We spent several minutes trying to identify Katy Perry. \u00a0She looks like Zooey Deschanel, and I was thinking Marion Cotillard...","330":"There was a point in my life when I visited CUT monthly, because it was SOOOO GOOD. Everything from the little cheese poppers (in lieu of bread), right down to the impeccable service, this place is a dream to dine at! Try the lobsters! It is surprisingly delish. They also slice up the lobsters with deft, orchestrated simultaneous strokes. Dessert is also a do. Yum yum yum!!!","331":"When in Singapore, I love the food here. \u00a0I don't question the quality...it always tastes fresh and lives up to its expectations. \u00a0The irony is, I'm not a fan of steak. \u00a0And either is my usual dining mate (who is vegetarian). \u00a0So we order salads and \"on the side\" dishes in droves and feast in that style for the evening. \u00a0The waitstaff has always been wonderful; sometimes we eat at the bar and chat it up with fellow patrons or the bartender. \u00a0Great ambiance. \u00a0Look forward to coming back again!","332":"frequented Mozza and DB Bistro but somehow avoided the steak house across because I've never had a good slab of steak here in Singapore... until I ventured into Cut. We started with the appetizer of bone marrow flan, it was creamy and flavorful and please do share it. No one should eat this entire dish alone. We also shared the steak tartare which was also fantastic but the serving was good for two. So two appetizers for two pax was too much. We ordered the US Wagyu Ribeye and the seasoning, texture, and doneness were perfect. I was blown away. I tried the different sauces they provided which were good but I prefer it without any sauces. We thought of ordering a side dish but wanted to save space for dessert.For dessert, we shared the souffle and it was the perfect exclamation point to a delicious dinner!","333":"I have not been to Cut for a proper meal but have been for drinks and dessert. Located in Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant is posh and one of the celebrity restaurants at MBS. Cocktails here are amazing. One of the best places to get cocktails here in Singapore. Its not cheap, but they do not skimp on alcohol here at all. The concotions are very interesting and sophisticated. Dessert here is very good as well. We tried the chocolate souffl\u00e9 which was amazing. A nice place to go for a chill night of drinks.","334":"Prices are ridiculous, especially for mediocre food that every other restaurant is doing. Where's the innovation?","335":"Expensive but great meat selection n good appetisers too. Order their pork belly n mac n cheese. Highly recommended!","336":"Great venue (too bad it's in a mall, albeit a very fancy one), the bar has good scene, the service is fantastic, and the steaks are just the best in Singapore. \u00a0Hands down! \u00a0Pricey, but not much more than other steakhouses in the city. \u00a0But unlike other steakhouses, here the quality of the meat is fantastic.","337":"This is one of my favourite laksas in Singapore. The gravy is really lemak and is properly spicy, the way I like it. The claypot also adds a little extra oomph to the taste\/overall laksa eating experience. The drawbacks are that the portion sizes are a bit small - I usually order medium - and they are a little stingy with ingredients. But maybe this is because I'm comparing the current standard to when the stall was still run by the father at the Depot Road location. I personally feel that the standard has dropped a bit since then. The other problem is that the parking is a little problematic at Bukit Merah as there are very few lots near the market. However, these are small complaints for me at the end of the day. I've still found myself coming back for more because this laksa really is that good.","338":"Nice and spicy laksa. \u00a0The soup itself is very tasty and spicy. \u00a0However, could use more stuff in the laksa. \u00a0More tofu? More shrimp? \u00a0Something to give it more texture, depth?","339":"Nice clay pot laksa but the standard is not as good as it used to be when the stall location was in depot road.","340":"I'm not the hugest fan of laksa mainly because I'm terrible at tolerating spicy food, but when something's good, I've just got to eat it, which explains my foray to katong for laksa from time to time. That was before I discovered Zhen Shan Mei, which is located much nearer to where I live. I used to get my convenient fix of laksa sitting on the stools inside Queensway Shopping Centre, in between a casual stroll looking around for sporty stuff. Now, a five minute walk across to Alexandra Village brings me to one of the most 'sedap' bowls of laksa you'll find in Singapore.Some may not like it this way, but I adore this because it's so thick, rich and a fairly oily, so it not only leaves me quite full, but also satisfied to last till my next craving. It always feels good to eat out of a claypot, so there's that factor to this too, but I believe it's the way it's warmed in claypots that brings out that flavour in the soup. I wouldn't note this for its spiciness, because I don't recall having that big a sweat eating this, but even if you crave the chilli you will surely still enjoy this! Just ask for added chilli on the side, perhaps.","341":"I had a fantastic experience here earlier this month, everything from the food to service was on point. Try to get a seat on the patio outside, it overlooks the marina and has views of CBD, Marina Bay Sands, and the Singapore Flyer. I would highly recommend all three soups on the menu (mushroom, lobster, and pumpkin). I tried the pasta trio taster and it was delicious. Not to mention they have one of the best tiramisus i've ever had!...it has a similar texture to a traditional panna cotta.I think Dolce Vita and Osteria Mozza at MBS are the two best fine dining Italian restaurants in the city.","342":"Casual relax environment on a Sunday evening. \u00a0Host is friendly and welcoming. \u00a0Gone through 3 lovely appetizers and they were nicely presented and tasted wonderful. The mains were equally good. \u00a0The disappointment was the desserts were mostly sorbet. \u00a0All in all a good place for causal Italian.","343":"We have been going to Dolce Vita every year for our anniversary since arriving to Singapore. \u00a0I am Italian and miss my Italian food very much and have always been so impressed with how fantastic the food tastes. \u00a0The ambiance is fantastic and the service is phenomenal.","344":"Good things never come cheap and I have to agree that it's for a valid reason. Priced too low and it'll be flooded with all the bargain hunters. A usual spot for my girlfriend and I, both of us enjoy the starter of freshly baked bread with olives a lot. We go through the loaves so fast that we end up being too full and having to go with \u00a0the lighter dishes like \u00a0pasta \u00a0instead. My favourite has to be the osso bucco, one of the best I've had so far and I find myself ordering it over and over again on return visits. Coming in a close second for me and first for her would be the beef tenderloin with foie gras. The place in general is quiet, and we like it that way. Dinner conversations are always a joy to have without having to scream to hear one another. We've heard that brunch here is good as well but have yet to try it so far.","345":"Been here twice for dim sums in the weekends, and both times I have been impressed by everything! \u00a0The good is good, the service is attentive, the venue and location are great, and all of this for half of the price of brunch at any PS Cafes! :-)Will continue to come back here!","346":"We went to a large corporate dinner, so we didn't choose what we ate, but dishes ranged from above average to very good. The main assets of the place are the superb view of Boat Quay, and the excellent service from a friendly and efficient team.","347":"Excellent quality pricy dishes beautiful viewsIt opened only for a month but the crowd on a Saturday is quite surprising, not busy but buzzing. Causually dressed in a business district, and quiet conversations happens in the background. The views of the river and skyline across is mesmerising. At 6.30pm we get some orange tinge across the cityscape. Nice. Probably more romantic then it was. The food is just as excellent. Dim sum and cantonese dishes in upclass setting by the river. Tri platter roast tops our expectation while the sweet sour soup was delicious, right amount of spicy and sour for Asian palate. The stir fried pork cooked right with texture soft and chewy. We like the mushrooms too. The scallop on asparagus is lightly fried and the sweetness comes thru with the first bite. Our lobster noodles came last to fill the stomach and it taste as good as it looks. Eating the lobster requires is a handful but the tender noodles is a bit bland considering all the flavourful dishes upfront. On the whole the experience is very pleasant though pricy. Will return for special occasions.","348":"Decent food and drinks with a nice view along the river. Reasonably priced especially in comparison to its \u00a0nearby competitors.","349":"Great food and experience. Came here for an anniversary dinner, and it's one of our favorite date spots. FOOD (they can flat out cook):* menu changes 2 or 3 times a year* must try: steak, uni toast, grilled romaine, paella SERVICE:* just the right amount of attentive* if you sit at the counter, then cooks interact with you as well* gave us an anniversary cakePRICE: * $$$$ (350 for 2 pax)* we did order quite a few dishes, and a bottle of wineOVERALL: * don't go too hungry...portions are small and dishes expensive* definitely sit at the counter* great experience...would go again","350":"Great food\/menu, entertaining atmosphere, attentive staff.Went for dinner on a Friday night and was very impressed. Sat at the bar, on the other side of which is the kitchen with the chef and his staff flying around carefully preparing each dish. Several times I saw the chef inspect food made by his staff, determine it wasn't quite right and have them do it again. Although I'm sure it was still good, I appreciated the dedication to only serving perfect food. The staff was also very good - very attentive, reminded you of the specifics of the dish when serving, and generally accommodating. Specifics below, but recommend ordering the Cauliflower and Pigeon and sit at the bar. The paella looked incredible - watched them make at least a dozen.Food:Chorizo Iberico Croquettes: really really good, could eat them until I was sickShishito Peppers - came in some chimichuri \/ sriracha sauce which was terrific - was a daily specialRoasted Cauliflower - really really good. Combination of the char from roasting the cauliflower with the couscous and the creamy sauce is a home run.Grilled Octopus - good, but in comparison to the other dishes, lacked flavorRibeye - great flavor, perfectly cookedPigeon - must order - cooked to perfect,very flavorful, could eat several orders of this","351":"I've eaten at wonderful restaurants all over the world, and this spot is one of my favorites. Although they can accommodate larger groups, you get the best experience with a small group seated at the bar. Everyone is friendly and accommodating, and the vibe is more neighborhood bar than fine dining. Oysters, prawns, cauliflower, paella and desserts are all amazing and beautifully presented.","352":"I have been to Esquina several times and I was initially a huge fan but I must say that it has really become worse. The Singapore outpost of Jason Athertons restaurant empire is not at all up to the level that one should be able to expect. The dishes are some sort of mid-sized dishes categorized by Sea, \u00a0Land and Soil. Much of the food is of very good quality, especially the Spanish Breakfast and the mini pork burgers standout. The food is however not the main problem, it is more the service that is faltering. We were just seated when we were told it is last orders. Why even accept reservations if you are closing the kitchen right away? The service was also in general slow, \u00a020 minutes wait for a beer when the place is virtually empty isn't ok. Staff were also mostly interested in talking on the phone or with each other. We also had them without asking opening bottles of water and charging 9.5++ SGD per bottle. Selection of beer is boring and over-priced but the wine selection is good and can recommend the Torello cava. The prices per glass are however cheaper than buying a bottle (they claim 5 glasses per bottle and the price for a bottle is 6.9 times the glass price - \u00a0waitress just stared at me and left when I pointed out it was cheaper to buy per glass. Probably not her fault but the management need to have better pricing strategy). This all sounds like the place is bad but the redeeming feature is the food so hope the management can produce some decent service as the prices should mean that one can expect both food and service to be good.","353":"Initially thought we were going to sit on the 2nd floor but happy we were seated along the kitchen bar. \u00a0The Head Chef from Barcelona was extremely pleasant to chat with and definitely made our experience memorable. Highly recommend grabbing a bite here and sparking up conversation with the kitchen staff- you won't regret it! Tapas were top notch and every dish was delicious! If we are ever in Singapore again we will be stopping by again!","354":"Fun place for a night out, plus the dishes are creative, novel and exciting.We had:- Mini Spanish breakfast: soft scrambled egg, mushroom and chorizo ketchup, baked potato foam ($10) - delicately served in a wooden box and on a bed of hay. The potato foam and the egg went deliciously well together, and was light on the palate, with the chorizo ketchup giving a nice homely aftertaste.- Esquina's Spanish omelette: confit onion, potato, crispy bread, olive oil caviar ($6) - this was alright, tasted more like lightly fried potato than anything.- Roasted cauliflower, cauliflower couscous, Serrano ham, manchego cheese ($16) - this was decent and flavorful; a tad too much oil though- Crispy baby squid, chili coriander, squid ink aioli ($14) - we ordered this at the spur of the moment, and it turned out to be one of our favorite dishes of the night. The squid was crispy and flavorful, and we loved the squid ink aioli. Perfect for munching over great conversation. Definitely get this to share.- Pigeon, forest berries escabeche, burnt Rosemary polenta, crisp shallots ($22) - this took forever to come, though the pigeon was juicy and tender. The berries were a nice touch. - Grilled Spanish octopus, Jerusalem artichoke, burnt onion, oyster leaf ($28) - the best dish of the night, in my books. The octopus was meaty and tender, loved the charred bits, and it went brilliantly with the artichoke puree. Highly recommend this.- Salted cod \"Alkorta\", iberico & tomato chickpeas, black garlic from \"Las Pedroneras\" ($28) - another brilliantly executed dish. The chickpeas and tender cod went fantastically with the sweetness of the black garlic, not to mention the visually stunning presentation. We were too full for dessert, but they did give us complimentary bites of chocolate ganache on bread.I liked that the chef made the effort to serve the dishes (we were seated at the bar) and introduce the dishes to us. However, the service was slightly off. The servers had a knack of interrupting us mid-conversation\/mid-bite. Got slightly annoying after awhile. Overall enjoyable and worth a visit!","355":"I really dig the shophouse feel. We dined on the second floor which felt like a private dining room. Our food was above average, but the service quality was below. It's a decent place for tapas and an OK wine list. I waiting for 20 min to get my beer after I ordered though. If Binomio is booked out down the road, this should be your next choice for tapas in the area.","356":"Popped in for lunch, very interesting setting and usage of narrow and long space by setting up bar seats and the chefs prepare the food right in front of you. \u00a0Chef Matthew is Spanish and is meticulous at crafting the dishes. \u00a0The layering of flavors, textures of ingredients is extremely creative and ingredients themselves are unique and fresh. \u00a0Chef Matthew is very creative, the basel and red pepper sorbets are awesome, so as the onion jam, fermented garlic paste, emulsified fish in the nigiri and the many other fantastic creations. The beauty is in using old school techniques and classic Spanish ingredients but presenting them in a new forms. \u00a0Impressive stuff.","357":"We made a reservation for two at 7pm inside, and were seated at the far end of the table where one seat wasn't really a seat but never mind.We asked the waitress how many plates should two people have and she answered three. Well three is a wrong number as we ended up ordering more and waiting and waiting because we didn't order at a go. How inefficient.We had the seaweed dashi poached oyster, which was okay, tasted like a boiled oyster with some dashi, nothing really special. I am not pleased to announce we were not impressed with the pork crackling as it tasted like pork flavored fried fish maw with some black roe on top. None of the lardy goodness we were expecting. We mostly got plates from the Sea section, the scallop sashimi with duck ham, lemon, and burnt cucumber was okay. Scallop sashimi has a delicate flavor and I felt the accompaniments overwhelmed it. Good accompaniments should accentuate the flavor instead. I did like that they left the scallops whole instead of slicing them thin or into pieces.Next up was the seared scallops with duck green curry and coconut rice. I don't eat peanuts so we got them on the side so that's good. The scallops were really good and seared properly but again the green curry didn't complement the scallops!We were hungry so we got the snapper, which was done quite well and came with pine nuts and couscous, with some orange. This went quite well as a dish and I rather enjoyed it. Last up for savories was the beef short ribs with cauliflower, tongue, and brown butter. This was a disappointment because we waited the longest for this and it tasted very ordinary. Well it just wasn't a party in my mouth. Meh. We ended the meal with desserts and had the chocolate mousse with popcorn milk and the manchego cheese pudding. We thought the popcorn milk sounded good on paper but it overwhelmed the mousse and textures wise, mousse and milk don't quite go well together.The cheese pudding was a welcome surprise as it was salty and sweet with the apricot jam that came with it. I liked it.Would I come here again? Probably not. This place is pricey, has soso service, and flavor combinations don't pair very well. I would go out on a limb and say this - the chef in charge of the menu is ballsy but doesn't have an amazing flavor palette. By tasting the food I think their cooking skills are up there, with excellent technique, but the menu is just a disappointment. There is innovative cuisine, and there is food mixed up on a platter. Every bite is a surprise, but not necessarily a good surprise.","358":"Believe it or not, my husband and I were able to immediately get a table at Esquina at 8 PM on a Friday WITHOUT reservations.* I have a sneaking suspicion that this only happened because Potato Head Folk recently opened and the crowd moved there for the next few weeks. Maybe walk-ins at Esquina will be possible until the hype dies down?Since I wasn't able to check out the interior, this review will strictly be about the food. As the dishes are tapas portioned, our server recommended that we order about 7 dishes between the 2 of us. Luckily, I wasn't too hungry that evening, so we were able to get away with just 5 (which definitely put our wallet at ease in the end.)I ordered 2 snacks. The warm thyme and onion bread was more like a typical butter croissant to me. I couldn't taste any of the thyme and onion. I did like the smoked bone marrow butter it came with, though- it was served in the bone, which was cool, and it had a distinct taste (in a good way.) My second snack was the pork crackling, which I loved. The dish is comprised of 2 big pieces of pork crackling, decorated with salt cod and smoked herring roe. It was creative and I'd order it again.For my main, I chose the \"soil\" category (basically, veggie based dishes.) I really enjoyed my beet salad. The burrata they used was what won me over. Hell, it also won Miguel over, and he doesn't even like beets! The raspberry and pinenut crumble was a nice touch and went well with the rest of the flavours. However, the truffle honey was a bit of a miss for me; Migs said he could smell it but I felt that it was lost amongst everything else that was going on.Despite the creative dishes, some of the flavours just don't come through. Considering the prices, I expect more. But I get the trendiness of it all, and it's definitely a place to be seen. I wouldn't come here if I were super hungry, but for drinks with friends or a light dinner, I'd be cool with it.--*Well, we did end up with a tiny table outside, which isn't ideal, but a table is a table! And yes, for the longest time, they didn't accept reservations, but now they do! Make your life a ton easier by booking an inside table through Chope. ;)","359":"This is a review of a dinner at Esquina. \u00a0This was a dinner with my manager. \u00a0He selected the restaurant. \u00a0It is one of his favourites.tinyurl.com\/aap4gfnThis was one of my favourite meals in Singapore. \u00a0This was primarily due to the quality of the food and the general energy of the other patrons enjoying their meals.The ambiance is a bit cramped. \u00a0But there is such a great energy from watching the food being prepared, taken out, and then quickly devoured by appreciative diners. \u00a0Most of the seating is along the bar. \u00a0There is some minimal outdoor seating. \u00a0I am not sure why they went with tractor seats for the bar stools. \u00a0They are not as painful as I thought they would be. \u00a0But they seem to be a needless form over function design decision. \u00a0There is a certain eclectic appeal to the decor.tinyurl.com\/bcupdhrtinyurl.com\/bjkjlolThe service was quite good. \u00a0Our server was very informative. \u00a0She checked often to see if things were moving along. \u00a0The food came out in a very orderly fashion.The food ranged from good to exceptional. \u00a0For me, the modern culinary movement is greatly about reinterpreting foods and cuisines with the best ingredients possible. \u00a0I think Esquina is doing that with tapas. \u00a0They are taking the form of small shareable plates and casting aside the traditional versions. \u00a0They are focusing on delivering excellent flavours created from quality ingredients to the plate without regard to whether it is a customary dish.Sea Urchin Bisque - This may be the best sea urchin dish I've ever eaten. \u00a0i tend to eat sea urchin alone. \u00a0But seeing it used as a component brought it to a completely different level.tinyurl.com\/b465fjbBeetroot Salad - This was a very unique salad. \u00a0it blended flavours and textures very well.tinyurl.com\/aqh8zf9Sea Bass - This was a very well prepared piece of fish. \u00a0It was perfectly cooked and simply allowed the taste of the fresh fish shine through.tinyurl.com\/axa2nm4Chicken Wings in a foam - The chicken was so tender and flavourful. \u00a0The foam added just a touch of sweetness. It really came together well.tinyurl.com\/bxpp6gkPork Cheeks - This was, to me, the weakest dish. \u00a0I know. \u00a0It is pork. \u00a0How can I say that about pork. \u00a0I just thought it was a touch dry. \u00a0The flavour was great. \u00a0The texture just didn't seem quite right.(no photo)Curry with lobster - This was a beautiful dish. \u00a0The curry was nice. At some level though, I thought the curry overpowered the sweetness of the lobster. \u00a0I think the dish could just as easily been made with a nice prawn. \u00a0Lobster is a delicate sweet taste. \u00a0it is easily lost.tinyurl.com\/bea95ouThis meal was compliments of my manager. \u00a0However, I do want to note that I think this is a dining experience worthy of the associated price. Overall - This stands within the five best meals i've enjoyed in Singapore. \u00a0The food is the star of the show. \u00a0But certainly the energetic ambiance provides a strong supporting role. \u00a0The service was also very good. \u00a0Esquina is the type of dining experience I look forward to sharing with others.(lol - i do not usually mention other reviews. \u00a0however, according to one of the other reviews, i must be pretentious if i like esquina. \u00a0i just want to say if that is the cost for enjoying this wonderful dining experience, so be it. \u00a0i will be as pretentious as it takes.)","360":"The four of us came here on a Saturday night. We tried to make reservation but they only do it for people dining at their \"supper club\" which serves pre-fixed menu only (around $95 I think). Knowing this is a popular spot we arrived pretty early at 6:30pm, and there was one, yes only one, outdoor table left for us.The food was decent. We loved the babe squid appetizer with squid ink aioli. For entr\u00e9e our favorites were smoked mackerel and beef wellington. Also worth mentioning was the Tiramisu - a deconstructed\/gastronomic version.However, the service was sub par. All the waitresses were nice but they just weren't around very much. It took us forever to get drinks, get our plates changed etc. Definitely feel like they were understaffed.","361":"For pictures and more reviews, visit my blog.Esquina is a haute tapas boutique where patrons perch precariously on weirdly shaped metal stools that will seriously damage some nuts. Not a place for large groups because you can hardly converse farther than your immediate left\/right. Ham Croquetas ($10) is my must order. 4.5cm tall balls filled with creamy bechamel and chunks of what is possibly iberico ham (i expect no less) left us wanting for more. The ham was a little salty but i love it.The Smoked Haddock, spring onion and Manchego omelette ($18) was the fluffiest eggs i've tried in a while. I would liken it to a souffle but firmer. The taste was light; simply flavored with the natural sweetness of the smoked haddock. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.Do order the Sauteed gambas, chili garlic, potato dumplings and bisque sauce ($24) even though it doesn't look spectacular. The prawns were fresh and bouncy and i love the rich bisque sauce so much i could inhale it. Gnocchi were meh.And oh.. the Beef Tartare.. simply divine... Extremely flavorful and smooth tartare, especially after you scoop the confit egg yolk onto it....Read more at ms-skinnyfat","362":"The good: \u00a0Although close quarters, I like the design\/space. \u00a0Open kitchen concept always calls for some dining entertainment. \u00a0Very unique vibe; felt like the crowd were regulars and everyone seemed happy to be there. \u00a0The bad: \u00a0Let's not beat a dead horse here, but there are some obvious areas for improvement. \u00a0The service could be better, the cost could be lower, the portions could be bigger, the food could be tastier and the seats could be more comfortable. \u00a0Aside from that though, it's great! The ugly: \u00a0I really don't understand how people RAVE about this place. \u00a0My only conclusion is that they are rich blokes with a high tolerance for butt pain (get your mind out of the gutter), astronomical bills and possess highly damaged taste buds. \u00a0With a few other good tapas options out there unless you are personal friends with the chef\/owner and\/or a cowboy, there isn't a good reason to go.","363":"It feels like they took quite a risk with the place - long and narrow, the indoor space can only afford to have an open kitchen and a single, overcrowded bar counter. But it somehow works, and it's constantly busy with customers returning for food which more than makes up for the slight discomforts. They have a few additional tables outdoors, but the ambience is definitely different from the flurry of activity taking place inside. We arrived after 7 on a Monday, and the indoor seats were already taken up. Nevertheless, the food was awesome, and we loved the clean, fresh flavours of the scallop cerviche. The Iberico Pork and Foie Gras Burger is delicious as well, but the foie gras flavours and textures weren't really present. The desserts - oh, the desserts - embody exciting flavours, and it was really difficult to make that final decision. A great place for tapas, that's for sure. Each dish in the meat and seafood categories will set you back at least SGD 20, but they're worth every penny.","364":"Intimate and friendly dining experience. Great food menu. The wine list was very disappointing. Prices are outrageous . Only 3 reds to choose from and 1 of them was out of stock. Let's think of improving the choice for the diner please.","365":"The wait can be excruciating given how tiny the place is. But I love the space, love the energy, love the service, love the food!!Our server told us that it was an exceptionally crowded for a Thu. We started by sitting outdoors getting our drinks while waiting for a table. The wait was 1.5 hours by the time we got a seat inside. While outdoors, we started with some crispy baby squids with our sangrias. The sangria is yummy! And the crispy squid lightly battered and served with squid ink aioli. Do not expect our local version of crispy squid, Esquina does it with the squid still soft and juicy inside, while only the exterior is crispy. Dishes:- sea urchin and crab bisque. Like what Mark D. said, absolutely wonderful. The sweetness of the urchin is perfect and it is served with clunky crab meat. It is also served beautifully plated on a stone bowl.- ham croquetas. Filled with chunky iberico jamon, wonderfully salty and balanced with the potato filling. - marinated beet salad. It is too difficult to get good beets in Singapore. I never liked beet until I moved to NYC, and eating beets there totally changed my mind about this muddy veggie. The version here is still not like the beets we get in NYC, but the execution of the dish is faultless. It is served with burrata cheese and honeycomb. The honeycomb gave an amazing finish to the entire dish that it gave me pure joy....- beef tatare with frozen foie gras and confit egg yolk. This is served in small portions served with toast. We were not sure on what to expect when we read frozen foie gras. But when it was served, I knew it was exactly like the shaven foie gras p\u00e2t\u00e9 dish that I had in David Chang's momofuku ko restaurant where he served it up like a bowl of savory ice-cream. Totally yummy, and I only wish they are more generous with the shavings here. Complex flavors, beautifully executed.- seafood paella. Do not expect the traditional Spanish paella. This doesn't come with the soccarat (crispy bottom bits). It is closer to a rendition of risotto without the cheese, so it is much lighter and you can really taste the seafood bisque that they use to cook the rice. The seafood is served on the side and you get snapper, shrimp and crispy squid. I didn't feel that I need the seafood at all, quite happy with just the paella.Overall, really enjoyed the dinner. The tiny space reminds me so much of the little restaurants that peppered the village in Manhattan. It was a blessing in disguise that Burnt Ends was full till 9.30pm, which is why we ended up here. I was not impressed with Jason atherton's other restaurants in Sg, this one now totally changed my mind. Now....if only the wait is shorter!","366":"I've been here 4 times and tried 30+ dishes (via foodmento app). Small innovative eats is one of my favorites foods. I would come here again sooner, but I think back to the damage the last 4 times...Dishes I LOVED: - salt & pepper squid- roasted pedron pepper- iberico pork & foie burger- sevllle orange & rosemary ice cream- roast duck, truffle honey...(special)- marinated beetroot saladDishes I FAILED:- beef tartatre- pan fried snapper- roast lamb rump- manchego custard","367":"Went there for dinner, away from kids. I have to say, ingredients used are all fresh. Excellent cooking overall, attentive and friendly service. Highly recommended for night out or casual after work gathering.","368":"Sooooo good! Fabulous service. Delicious food. I'm definitely coming back. Loved the sea urchin. Loved the scallop ceviche. Roast duck breast was yum. We've been telling all our friends about it. The set lunches are reasonable too.","369":"Some have said that one should arrive early to get a seat especially on Fri\/Sat or be prepared to queue. Ironically, we promptly arrive at 6pm but it was only ready for service after 15minutes. The place was about 80% full and the service was insincere for some. There were both hits and misses with the food but one gripe is that the size really can be afforded to be more generous even though they are tapas. Otherwise, it might be better to charge tapas price for tapas rather than main course prices for tapas.Foodwise, it was acceptable to me to experiment with the new creations but not for The Folks who commented that they had no idea what they were eating that night. Perhaps Spanish tapas might not be the cup of tea for everyone but I shall still continue to search for one that will be comfortable not only to the tastebuds but also to our stomachs and pocket.","370":"I love tapas bars so when I heard Jason Atherton had opened one in Singapore, I quickly rounded up a couple of friends to check it out. We waited for about 45 minutes to get seats ... and that was at 930pm. Esquina doesn't take reservations, and I realise upon getting a seat that I might as well have eaten standing because they were really awkward and uncomfortable.Food : Wow, the heritage tomatoes with sherry dressing were something else. Fresh, juicy and sweet ... one of the best tomatoes we have had in a while, including the momotaro ones we usually have in Japanese restaurants. Good ham croquetas and we really loved the gambas as well as the scallop ceviche. The slow cooked egg was quite good and the ox cheek was quite soft and tender. The Iberico pork and foie gras burger was the winner of the night for my two friends however, they couldn't stop raving about it. We also really liked the sangria ice cream cone ... I think it was a daily special though.Ambience : Like the trend that seems to be going around for tapas bars, it also has an industrial chic vibe. But unlike Foodbar Dada, the seats are uncomfortable and almost make us feel they are discouraging diners from getting too comfortable.Service : Quite decent. Even more so when there isn't a service charge levied.Change the chairs goddammit.","371":"Chinatown in Singapore is not exactly where you'd expect to find a top notch Spanish restaurant. \u00a0But that's exactly where you'll find Esquina Tapas Bar. \u00a0'Esquina' translates to 'corner' and true to its name, the tapas bar is located on a street corner, in Chinatown. This place has serious cooking credentials. \u00a0Culinary Director Jason Atherton, notably Gordon Ramsey's protege, Michelin star winner and the first British Chef to complete a stage at the famed el Bulli restaurant in Spain, has teamed up with Irish Executive Chef, Andrew Walsh to create a stunning modern tapas restaurant. Esquina is reminiscent of tapas bars you would find in Spain. \u00a0A long, thin hallway with a bar, high stools and an open kitchen provides a chilled, relaxed atmosphere. \u00a0It's all about the food here, and you get the feeling you're in for a treat the moment you step through the door.The menu is innovative and exciting and there are also blackboard specials. \u00a0This is not your average chorizo and meatball menu, this is a whole other level of tapas entirely. Mr M, who requested to be referred to as 'The Stuntman' in this post (ok, I'll indulge him) and I dine on a Tuesday evening, and it's packed with a cool vibe. \u00a0The staff are friendly and we take our stools at the bar with the perfect view of the kitchen. \u00a0Executive Chef Andrew Walsh is on-board this evening and he helps us with our menu selections. The Stuntman and I choose our menu as follows:* Iberico Bellota* Tuna Tartare, wasabi celeriac remoulade, vietnamese dressing, crispy shallot (blackboard special)* Marinated beetroot salad, honeycomb burrata, pinenut crumble* Grilled Rib-eye, spice aubegine puree, lentil pearl barley dhal* Baked bone marrow with snails, parsley and horseradish pesto* Berry sorbet (compliments of the chef)* Watermelon salad, gazpacho, basil sorbet The food is exceptional and beautifully presented, with the standouts for me being the beetroot salad and the bone marrow (no easy feat given I wouldn't usually order bone marrow, or snails, for that matter)! This is an underground foodie den and well worth adding to your dining itinerary when you're next travelling through Singapore. \u00a0Imagine your street cred when you whip out this gem. \u00a0I have to say, Singapore has some amazing dining experiences - it's a foodie's paradise, take note!","372":"Im a massive massive tapas fan, and have spent many a good night in Esquina since it has opened. It has a very cool, industrial chic feeling to the small and narrow dining room. Sitting by the long bar looking across at the chefs prepare everything adds to the experience of this place. Unlike some of the other tapas places around Singapore, the food here is both contemporary and exciting.Had the tuna tartare was both fresh in produce used and flavor, tuna, avocado and sesame, simple , easy and worked really well. Full English breakfast was both a clever play on words and on the palate. \u00a0Desserts!! Strawberry gazpacho with basil sorbert was a fantastic way to finish. I've had too many bad basil sorbet experiences in my time, they are either far too sweet or don't resemble basil at all, though this one nailed it and married perfectly with the soup.","373":"Maybe it was because I had high hopes for this place. After looking through the reviews and pictures, I was really excited about the food because they looked beautiful in the posted pictures. Unfortunately, Esquina didn't deliver for me. The plating was beautiful, the service was good, and the decor of the place was chic and pretty. The most important thing though, the taste and flavor of the food, did not do it for me. We ordered all the popular dishes I've read about in the reviews. The pork cracking was just....fried pork skin. The pairing of the herring roe and salt cod mousse did not really push the taste of the pork to greater heights. Instead, it was just in general a flat dish. I have the same criticism for most of their dishes. The ingredients are good, but they just do not come together to deliver a dish of finesse or overlapping flavors. The jambon croquetas were good for what they were, fried cheese balls with ham, but even that was a tad too salty. The whipped burrata with beets was visually an astounding dish to look at, but again the essence of each element did not shine through. The burrata lacked the distinct milky taste, the pinenut crumble did not even taste strongly of pinenuts. So apart from the welcoming acidity the pickled beets brought, the dish was again flat, with no complexity. The uni bisque actually did have a good taste, and chock full of crabmeat that could have been sweeter, but the crab flavor overwhelmed the delicate uni flavor, and as a result, after the initial taste, the uni taste was barely detectable. Arguably the best dish of the night though. The pulled pork and foie gras burgers had good flavors going on, albeit a little too salty. I do appreciate that they blended the foie gras in the pulled pork patty. The sauerkraut was a little redundant though. In general, I thought that the items were overpriced for the taste level and the amount of food served.","374":"Great food but tiny portions. Went for lunch so didn't need to queue at all. Had the steak tartare which was great and the beetroot salad was refreshing. The beef cheek with ox tongue was delish as well. Tip: don't go there hungry unless you have cash to splash!","375":"Definitely a great meal, but for tapas, pricey to the point that it's not worth spending what you will. Rather spend a bit less at a tapas spot like Binomios or Sabios, or spend the money on a full meal.","376":"Absolutely horrendous and unacceptable levels of service. I would have loved to comment on the food but the sad thing is that the food that we ordered did not arrive at all. \u00a0We had expected our food to arrive, as we were given fresh plates and cutlery while waiting. After waiting at our table outside the restaurant for approximately 30 minutes, we decided to check on our orders with the waitress\/hostess who took them. When we asked the said waitress about our orders, she simply turned to the kitchen, without acknowledging our query, and asked the crew if our food was on the way. Crew informs her that it was not. The waitress turns back to us and curtly informs us that our food \"is not coming\". No apology was given nor an explanation proffered. Her dismissive attitude was completely shocking. It was as if we had spoilt her evening and put her in a bad mood, and not the other way around. I should point out that we did not even complain about the wait, but merely queried her on whether our food was coming. I don't care how good your food is if you treat your customers like crap. I get that orders sometimes get lost in the process, particularly at a busy joint like this. But no customer should be treated dismissively after a fruitless and unnecessary wait for the food. It's sad that my experience was marred by one person's truly appalling service.","377":"Yes, Jason Atherton does make me gravitate towards Esquina even without asking around if it was any good. While I fully know he's not gonna be cooking my tapas, I had the prior faith that Esquina will justify my good faith, and I won't say I'm disappointed. It's small, it's popular and overcrowded, but if you actually do get a seat by going strategically at 6pm, the rewards are sweet. Watching the finesse of two chefs working\/performing in front of you, agile, swift and serious, I can hardly discount any dish as so-so. The effort is worth half the battle. But have you tasted the gorgeous \u00a0heritage tomatoes or the slow cooked eggs? I'm not saying that you will NEVER taste any better, for what I have to pay for them, I'd say dish them out every dinner! It's definitely worth my money, the consistent doneness of the egg with the patatas brava spin off is awesome. If the leg of ham doesn't instill any faith in how serious they are, I don't know what will.","378":"Laksa is usually not on my list when it comes to eating a non-messy, no-sweat meal. However, my friend said that I have to try the laksa at this place, so after deliberating for a good amount of time, I finally decided to take the plunge. And I should probably thank my friend for that.The laksa here is really good because of one thing: the gravy. The coconut milk infused gravy has a very rich and thick taste, and I could not stop myself from finishing all of it (are you nuts??!!). The level of spiciness was just right so I did not sweat like a pig, as I would usually do when eating spicy stuff.The laksa also came with a good amount of cockles which added that oomph to the already-awesome laksa. Overall, this is really a great place to visit for some mouth-watering laksa; even non-laksa lovers are going to love this.","379":"I have been craving for Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa but have not got the chance to visit them in Jalan Berseh. Thanks to my colleague who brought me down to Jurong East and enjoy similar bowl of Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa without travelling too far.Famous Sungei Road Trishaw LaksaUnlike the original stall in Jalan Berseh, this stall offers other food items like Mee Siam & Mee Rebus. Not only that, healthy choice option is adopted here with whole grain noodles used.Laksa comes in 2 sizes, $3 and $3.50. The $3 portion is already quite good enough for a meal as ingredients like fishcakes & fresh cockles together with the noodles were rather filling. However if I were to compare them to the one I used to have, I will comment that Laksa gravy spelled the differences. Their gravy was diluted and lack of the usual fragrance even though the taste was rather distinct. For additional spicy kick, do remember to add in their sambal chilli.Laksa - $3Taste in overall was close and it was really good that at such a price without travelling too far, I still can enjoy a stomach warming bowl of Trishaw Laksa like this in Jurong.","380":"Great lunch spot. Just order one of the two waygu dons and that is more than enough food to satisfy a wagyu don craving.Love sitting at the bar and watching the chef book your food on the grill.Unfortunately I got suckered by the waiter into ordering a few sides because he said the waygu don is a small portion (it was more than enough). So ended up wasting untouched mushrooms and shishito peppers.Prices are as crazy as they've been since I started coming here some 2 years ago. Don't order sushi here even though they call is high quality. My orders of king salmon and large scallop were both just awful.Location is very awkward, attached to a general hospital. You have patients coming out in wheelchairs attached to an ivy drop and here we come out of an Mercedes Uber to eat at a steakhouse. \u00a0Definitely worth checking out.","381":"Great set lunch deal. Walked out belly full. Wagyu steak was good. Though a couple of slices were a tad sinewy. But the rice below was so good.","382":"Really good food, despite the odd location at a medical centre. Had the wagyu donburi set - beef was really nicely seared but juicy on the inside, onsen egg was perfectly cooked, the black truffle was a nice touch. Service was friendly and efficient. Make a reservation, as it's pretty full for lunch. Only taking a star off for the location and the prices.","383":"The standard of the food here dropped tremendously from the last time I've been here. I usually enjoy my steak w. a tinge of salt and that will be perfect. But the steak here is not as good as I remembered. The taste was blend and dissatisfying; I had to drown it in the ginger sauce to give it a taste.","384":"The fois nigiri is simply my favorite bite of food at Uchi, and perhaps in the world, so when I saw fois donburi on the menu at the Fat Cow I knew where I was going to eat. I was only in Singapore for 2 days, and they are closed on Sunday, so Monday lunch was my only opportunity. Thankfully they had the fois donburi as a lunch set item. My hotel is right around the corner, so for me this was a convenient location, but it's about 10-15 mins away from the CBD. Singapore isn't very big and I was actually coming from the CBD doing touristy things, so I can assure you it's worth the $7 cab ride (even less in USD). This restaurant is oddly located in a medical center, so don't worry about the heart arrack options, you're in good hands with Singapore's healthcare system.","385":"Fat cow is definitely a place to try. The place may be a bit difficult locate (ok at least it was for me because I was not acquainted with Camden Medical center before that), but it was worth the long walk (we walked from Ion - took about 15min). The place was pretty packed when we went at 1300hrs for lunch, and because we didn't make reservations, we were asked to come back at 1400hrs (SO, DO CALL IN BEFORE DROPPING BY!). We both had the set lunch (ranges from about $35-$50), which is quite reasonable for such a pricy place. It comes with soup, chowaimushi, salad, and the entr\u00e9e. Let's just say that I experience heaven when I first ate the wagyu don. The meat was nice and tender, and I love the sauce on the rice so much I ate everything - that's a big deal because I'm not a great fan of rice!I was also pleased to see that they had an extensive selection of Umeshu. On the rocks is the best way to go! :)","386":"Very good in food, service, environment. Not difficult to make reservation. The only thing makes me rate it only 4 stars is not professional in details. The A5 beef is served in low temperature, which impacts the overall taste. Not very impressive, but good enough!","387":"Last time this is my favorit place to have lunch, donburi \u00a0rice is nice. The beef so tender n juicy, foigrass so nice ,but I feel nowadays the quality of taste abit different.","388":"Extremely nice restaurant. The steak was devine!!!!! The prices are steep but worth it if you are a true meat lover. Nice decor & ambiance.Agree its a bit difficult to locate if you are not familiar with the area.","389":"Before I walked into Fat Cow, I was expecting a very small portion with huge prices. This was far from the truth. They actually had many cheaper options on the menu and they are JUST as good as the more expensive options.\"Then what sets them apart?\", you say?Well... you get EXACTLY what you pay for - \u00a0you can order a whole steak... with a side of that delicious japanese rice with egg or you can spend 35 -40ish with cubed wagyu with rice and an egg in a claypot. BOTH were good!Down here.. you can still decide if you wanna splash out the cash or still have a very decent meal at a decent price.I've heard tht this was a place for beef so of course I went for the 40 day aged wagyu with a side of rice, onsen egg and ordered m'self some foie gras! It was my birthday weekend anyways! :)My friends ordered the claypot beef rice thingie and another had the wagyu steak and a side of beef tartar. Both very yummy indeed!Being a major beef lover, I'm the kind that either hardly eats any beef if it isn't good but if I DO have a beef craving, i'm going to make sure its a good cut and mostly costs over $40 anyways.You can be sure I'll be putting this little gem in my pocket of \"places-to-go-for-good-beef\"!BTW... I heard the lunch specials here are very affordable and worth it! Those who have that extra free time or don't have to work like the rest of us, well don't say I didn't mention it! You can thank me later! :)4.8 STARS","390":"Foie and wagyu is pretty expensive and its hard to get in NorCal. California banned foie gras for a couple of years and then allow foie lovers to consume this rich protein early 2015. Thanks being said, when I see a restaurant serving two of my top 5 favorite proteins, I'm on a mission to clog my arteries. Ordered the fat foie and wagyu donburi bowl and the truffle sea bream sashimi.The truffle sea bream sashimi was good but not fantastic. They put too much truffle oil and ponzu that overpowers the fish. As for the donburi bowl. I'm happy that they gave a 1:1 foie\/wagyu portion but was sad that the wagyu lack the natural beef flavor bc it was season with some garlic soy. The beef was cooked nicely and it passed as a filet.Overall, service was on point but food was mediocre.","391":"There are great restaurants and there are MEMORABLE restaurants. Fat Cow is one of those memorable restaurants that you will talk about for a very a long time. I brought my wife here for our 2nd year wedding anniversary based on the glowing reviews on yelp.The Food was good, that's an understatement. The Ambience was sexy and dark, that's an understatement. The rice, yes I segregate rice from food because in my world rice reigns supreme, was sublime, that's an understatement.When you come to Fat Cow, there are two dishes you MUST order: the Wagyu steak (pick any grade, they are all out of this world) and the Fat Rice. The Wagyu at Fat Cow unlike any steak I've ever tried. It has the tenderness of a tenderloin yet the juicy taste of Ribeye. However, the pride and joy of Fat Cow is the PHAT Rice. ;-) \u00a0Perfectly cooked high grade Japanese rice layered with the oil drippings of the very Wagyu just prepared for you a few minutes prior. \u00a0Holy smokes!!!To tell you the truth, I started my dinner with the Fat Cow Donburi - Wagyu Beef with Onsen egg and shiro negi. However, as soon as I saw my wife's Wagyu place across from with the fat rice arriving soon thereafter, I immediately had buyers remorse. I ate my Donburi as I fast can, which was good, but no where near the quality of the Wagyu dish sitting across from me. As soon as I was done, I ordered exactly what my wife ordered and I had no regrets!This dinner was truly special in more ways than one. However, for me to judge Fat Cow purely on its merits, I would consider it among the very best dining experiences I have ever had. \u00a0Did I mention we also had Australian Pinot Noir to accompany our fabulous dinner. :-)","392":"Great place for Japanese-style steaks, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki. The appetizers and desserts are also awesome. If you have the Entertainer application you can get main courses one-for-one which is a great deal.","393":"Fat Cow, oh Fat Cow, can you please be less delish so that I would not turn into a fat cow myself?The lunch deal is an amazing deal for the budget-conscious. Perfectly Charcoal-grilled wagyu with a perfect onsen egg - mix it all in over Japanese rice and your meal is complete. The set also comes with chawanmushi (not the best I've had, but you are not here for this), a salad, miso soup, and ends with a daily dessert. The day that I was there, it was an amazing honeycomb ice-cream that still has pieces of honeycomb in it. Perfect for the recent hot weather. All these for under s$40.This is only a review for lunch and I can't wait to go for dinner, or another lunch, or another whatever at Fat Cow.Reservation is a must!","394":"I'm not on here to talk about how awesome all the cows served in the restaurant (because hands down, everyone knows it's spectacular) but on the side dishes and a drink instead. At first, I ordered the Phat Rice aka Fat Rice, that costs $8 because of all the reviews I read, but oh man, I was hugely disappointed. It's just like regular gohan with a few drops of soy sauce that the restaurant claims to be some legit oil (in fact, it's just like a plain gohan to be honest).I was hugely amazed by the glistening and gorgeous-looking Zosui rice though! I knew it, from the moment I saw it on the menu book that it would be such an incredibly astonishing meal. For those of you who wonder what the heck is Zosui, well, according to an encyclopedia, Z?sui is a Japanese rice soup made from pre-cooked rice and water. BUT! Instead of water, the Zosui in Fat cow is made of AUTHENTIC BEEF AND MUSHROOM BROTH! Can you imagine??! No? Okay, go try it yourself then. :DFor the drinks, my partner and I ordered a light alcohol drink with peach and lychee flavor, on the rock. The alcohol content was just nice for an early dinner, tastes slightly sweeter than Umeshu but I love it. The only disappointing thing was the amount served, just way too little. :(Service and interior wise, it was wonderful!","395":"Wow. Was I impressed. Not only does this restaurant offer A5 wgayu from Japan and beef bowls, they also serve delicious sashimi and sushi.We ordered the set lunch which is a great deal and a lot cheaper than the regular menu.The menu also offers different cuts of cow (hence the name) as well as Australian and Japanese wgayu, American beef, shabu shabu.. etc... The set lunch comes with appetizers- salad, miso soup, and egg custard pudding. All yummy. The egg had shrimp and mushroom in it, and it tastes just like the ones in Japan.Sushi Moriawase, 46Chef's choice of 10 premium sushiI did not expect this to be amazing.. but boy was I wrong. There was toro, salmon, scallops, hamachi, red snapper (last three not sure) and salmon roe. The toro melted in your mouth.. and all the fishes were super tender and fresh. The salmon also melted in your mouth which was unexpected because its salmon... ugh I loved this plate.The Fat Cow Donburi, 38Charcoal grilled wgayu beef with onset egg & shiro negi- wow. for some reason they failed to mention there was truffle on it. like why would you omit that from the menu? Nice surprise, and damn was the meat cooked perfectly and extremely tender and flavorful. Fat Foa-Gura Don, 45Glazed foie gras and grilled wgayu beef over rice. omg. everything about this bowl was perfect. added a poached egg on the side, but it wasn't necessary. The sauce on the meats were already enough and so so good.. and the rice with the sauce was great as well. This bowl was .... perfect. I was already full from the sushi but I couldn't stop eating because it was that good.. Also had red radishes (I think) on the side to go along with it.You would think a restaurant not focusing on any type of food and having all these different types of Japanese food would decrease its quality and taste, but not this one. Everything was top notch and extremely yummy. When I'm back in Singapore, you will most definitely find me here.","396":"Went on a Saturday while I was in town and enjoyed an amazing set menu meal. I had the Wagyu Beef with a soft egg\/ Wagyu Nigiri\/ Shishito Peppers\/ and a few other appetizers. Absolutely great service and atmosphere. The food was delicious and priced reasonably considering the quality. I went for lunch on a Saturday and I recommend getting a reservation. I'll be back next time I'm in Singapore.","397":"Its hard to find a better experience than this. Food and service were awesome. If you're looking for a japanese inspired steak house, THIS IS IT! Bar none. You gotta try it.","398":"There have been mixed reviews on the restaurant and one thing I heard was that the food doesn't justify the price. However, with the downward revision of the already affordable lunch sets, I don't think anyone would be deterred from checking FC out. Each set comes with salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert with your choice of mains. Pick from the 12 mains which are priced from $25 to $48. Don't worry if you're not a beef fan, there are sashimi, pork and chicken on the menu too.The chawanmushi was topped with a light tasting crab sauce and it has prawn, mushroom and scallop in it.We ordered the Kinoko ($14), assorted Japanese mushrooms braised with sake, lime and butter. Honestly, it tasted like normal stir fry with a tinge of lime. A disappointment really. And it was a rather small portion.We also tried the Nasu Dengaku ($10), barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso. This is a tiny baby Japanese eggplant and it certainly isn't worth the price tag. There was a plum undertone in the salty miso which didn't sit well with the girls.We had the 2 hot favorites at Fat Cow, which is the Fat Foa-Gura Don ($42) and The Fat Cow Donburi ($38). It was a tussle between the 2 choices but here's the flavor profiles so that you can decide for yourself! The Fat Foa-Gura Don has the rich and buttery glazed foie gras chunks and grilled wagyu beef cubes. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but the overall flavor is strong and heavy. I liked the toppings on this one but i found the rice to be a little on the dry side and it acted like a sponge, soaking up all the oil from the goose liver..The Fat Cow Donburi is a simpler dish in comparison but it has its own merits. Charcoal grilled Wagyu Beef with a light garlic flavor, with onsen egg and shiro negi. The first thing we noticed about the dish was its truffle aroma.Break the egg and mix everything together and enjoy the moist and flavorful rice. Absolutely delicious.","399":"This is another amazingly beautiful room. \u00a0The 3D wooden matrix celling is nothing short of beautiful.Link to external source for interior photo:tinyurl.com\/8fujph3Along with the beautiful room, the conservative Japanese influenced service was excellent. \u00a0The servers were consistently insuring the meal was moving forward. \u00a0They were each very professional and polite.My friend does not drink sake. \u00a0She selected a cocktail called the Unusual. \u00a0Unfortunately, I can't remember what she thought of this cocktail.With a little input from the server, I decided on a sake for myself. \u00a0After selecting my glass from the tray offered, I tried the sake \u00a0(DASSAI JUNMAI DAIGINJO) and was quite pleased. \u00a0I tend to lean more towards sake with a profile featuring slight touches of fruit.The food ranged from good to very good. \u00a0Honestly, I was expecting very good to excellent. \u00a0 Some dishes flirted with this but I do not think they quite reached it.Sushi Mori - Featuring very high quality fish and strong preparation, this was a very enjoyable dish.tinyurl.com\/9oq7ey4Truffle Fries - These were also very good. \u00a0I could certainly taste the truffle. \u00a0Plus, the fries had a very nice crispiness.tinyurl.com\/8zyaa8uZuchini Blossom Tempura - This was one of the highlights of the meal. \u00a0The tempura blossoms were stuffed with Hokkaido scallops. \u00a0It was a delicate and subtle dish. \u00a0The presentation was very impressive.tinyurl.com\/8mjcsyrWagyu Ox Tendon & Foie Gras - I did not try this dish. \u00a0I have made a personal choice not to eat foie gras. \u00a0My friend said it was good but not great. \u00a0She grew a little tired of the tendon.tinyurl.com\/9rqmwxySnake River Farms US Wagyu Steak - This was good. \u00a0it was cooked perfectly. \u00a0However, I thought the cut was a little on the small side. \u00a0Plus, it was a bit bland. \u00a0It is possible that it was not properly rested before slicing.tinyurl.com\/9zzsq7bShabu Shabu with Grade 3 Japanese Beef from the Kagoshima Prefecture - This was good. \u00a0The overall presentation was very nice. \u00a0I do think though that due to its nature, the depth of flavors of the meat in shabu shabu is limited. \u00a0Hence, the special sides for increasing the flavor. \u00a0My favorite part of the shabu shabu was actually the mushrooms. \u00a0They were divine. \u00a0tinyurl.com\/99zxd4xOverall, this is a beautiful restaurant with truly excellent service. \u00a0I just thought the food fell ever so slightly short. \u00a0From a presentation standpoint, I thought it held up to any restaurant I've visited in the last year. \u00a0However, from a flavor standpoint, I thought it fell a tad short of some others. \u00a0When visiting restaurants of this caliber and expense, the expectations are very high.","400":"Fat cow is for meat lovers. They have sea food and Sushi like any Japanese restaurant, But you don't go there for that. Besides there are other places, arguably better. No you come for the beef. Forget the fancy Japanese meat dishes and just go for the slab of steak. They have Japanese, Australian and US. Skip the rest and head for the Japanese to really sample authentic wagu cooked to perfection. Order medium rare at most. Anything more cooked is sacrilege. Side dishes are meager but very good. The stuffed zucchini flowers are excellent, as are the various salads. Order the smaller portion of meat. Your wallet and stomach will thank you. The high fat content will fill you if you take the time to savor each piece. This is not the time to wolfing down your meal. Chew more times than you normally do before swallowing to get the full experience. \u00a0A side dish of fat rice is the perfect accompaniment. \u00a0Be prepared to pay through your nose though, but for that special occasion, go for it.","401":"Gourmet lunch on a budgetDining at Fat Cow can quickly burn a huge hole in your pocket, so if you're not looking to spend upwards of $250 on a meal, there're also the +\/- $60 lunch sets. Us group of ladies decided on a Friday treat and managed to snag an inside table for 6. Most of us ordered the donburi despite the carbo threat - honestly, don't waste a single grain of the perfectly plump, chewy, sticky short-grain rice; it's that good. While 1 friend took the Hokkaido don (with seasonal seafood), 3 others ordered the Wagyu donburi with onsen egg while 2 of us went for the foie gras & wagyu donburi. The wagyu was everything you hope it would be - fat glistening cubes of meat that almost melted in the mouth with no resistance. I didn't expect the cubes of wagyu to be of such high quality - at least A3 if not higher. \u00a0The crisp pan-seared cubes of foie gras also had a nice smoky char that added to the fragrance of the bowl. I love my fatty (eg flavourful) meats, so this portion was perfect. Some thought it was a little too much but finished up anyway. The lunch set also includes miso soup, salad, a chawanmushi and dessert, all of an amazing quality that gives you a taste of the full fledged experience.Lunch sets available from Mon-Fri only, 12-3pm.","402":"this was a great lunch! the decor is beautiful with a 3d wooden cube structure on the ceiling that elicited notes of traditional japan while still being contemporary.on to the grub:i ordered the wagyu beef cubes with foie gras donburi. the beef was slightly overcooked versus my order of medium rare, but the foie gras was cooked perfectly. the rice was a bit plain, some gravy would have been groovy. i tried my friend's wagyu with egg donburi and that was much better. the hamachi carpaccio with truffles was heavenly, although the taste was a bit heavy.the mushrooms were no bueno - flavors were too strong and too salty. we barely ate any of it.I also had one of the grilled prawns. it was quite nice, fresh and cooked perfectly.service:service was poor. my grilled prawn came after my dessert ice cream. really? also, i asked for a water refill and waited 15 minutes for them to top off my cup. there aren't even that many customers here, how can they be so slow?","403":"If you are a vegetarian you have not a lot of options here. 4 veggie side dishes that are insanely expensive. I mean 3 slices of sweet potato for 12S$? Really?The vegetable tempura was not that good. I had better in cheaper places like Shin Kushiya. But the service was very good and very nice. Overall much to expensive for what you get.","404":"After all the rave reviews on Yelp, I was really excited to try this place out for the awesome lunch. I like to visit atas restaurants for lunch first, and if the taste agrees, I will proceed to having dinner. I was super excited about this foie gras and wagyu beef rice bowl, and boy, did it disappoint. The first time it was served, it wasn't what I expected. I had asked for rare, and dark chunks of over-cooked beef and foie gras (meagre serving) was just not what I had hoped for. I sent it back and the second time, it was still slightly overcooked but I did not want to send it back the second time. The thing that really gets me was the lack of marinate\/ flavor in the beef cubes. It tasted like it was just salty, with no umami whatsoever. Service was good, servers were very professional. For a meal that was $48++, I will not be coming back. The food just did not deliver.","405":"Holy Fat Cow, what a mindblowing experience!That is all.Oh alright if you insist.Food : The zucchini blossom tempura stuffed with Hokkaido was delicious! Light and crisp yet extremely more-ish. Love. We also had the wagyu ox tendon pan seared foie gras and daikon ... the flavor was really brought out by the fact that it was slow cooked although I'm personally not a fan of ox tendon, and was nicely balanced by the daikon. We opted for shabu-shabu and charcoal grill, and was recommended the Japanese Grade A5 and the US Wagyu respectively. Both turned out absolutely mindblowingly out of this world delicious. We could have eaten the whole cow!Ambience : The people behind Fat Cow have taken over the premises that housed the former Le Figue and turned it into something chic and gorgeous.Service : Excellent although the attentiveness of the chefs became a bit unnerving after a while.Not for the fainthearted.","406":"Their beef and foie gras bowl is worth every penny... Although every time I finish, I'm tempted to order another bowl.","407":"Way overpriced for what you get, service is terrible and the place will be closed in less than a year.The menu is designed to deceive you. The waiter explains that the beef is priced per 100grams, but you have to pay for a minimum of 200 grams, and the chef weighs the piece that they have, so you have no idea what it is going to cost. We got a cut each of the Australian Wagyu and the US Wagyu for $360. Between four people that is a ridiculously small amount of beef for the price.Starters were the dumplings and the sashimi special for $120 and it is itty bitty portions. Now the food was delicious, but there is no way you can justify that price for some raw fish that would fit on the average side plate.The beef was decent, but it does not take that much experience to cook it medium. We popped a bottle of wine for $170 and that rounded out the whole overcharged experience.A couple of tips for the management:1. Charge less or serve more. Your menu is misleading, and I hate being ripped off.2. If your restaurant is empty, why were some menu items unavailable?3. Train your servers better. Every time I took a sip from my glass, the waiter refilled it. In addition, they hovered around our table watching us before ordering, and watching us eat. Majorly annoying when you are trying to enjoy yourself with friends.4. Change the name and the location, they are both stupid.5. Better yet, just close up. You are not offering an awesome enough experience for $160 per head","408":"I love steaks. I am always on the look out for a nice slab of marbled meat. So far, Fat Cow's steak is the best I've ever tried. Being a big fan of steaks, I ordered the A5* wagyu steak, seared to medium rare.*A5 is the highest grade being awarded to wagyu beef. It is determined based on its marbling score, meat colour and brightness, firmness and texture of meat, and color\/quality of fats.The steak was 300g and cost $298++. That comes up to more than $1\/g and every mouthful that I took was probably worth $10 but it was so worth it! The divine taste of beef, fats that melted away without giving a greasy feeling, coupled with the grainy yet tender texture of the meat created the perfect steak ever. Every bite that I took, I went straight into heaven, lingered there for awhile, before coming back down for another bite. It was really that good. Of course, this was also the most expensive steak I've ever eaten so I was glad it measured up to expectations. The steak was served with a shoyu dip with grated ginger and sesame. Initially, I was skeptical about dipping such a marblellous piece of steak into shoyu but wow, the shoyu brought out the sweetness of the beef!!! We also asked for some freshly grated wasabi to pair with the beef because we liked that combination.We also ordered a few other dishes to share before the steak arrived. Traditional 'onsen-egg' served warm with a hunk of crispy fried beef bone marrow in a citrus dashiThe bone marrow was crispy and light with a tinge of sweetness while the citrus dashi added a refreshing taste. Break apart the yolk and you have a creamy balance of sweet and saltiness. A perfect appetiser!The zucchini stuffed with snow crab was amazing! The tempura was light and crispy yet not oily and there was a large amount of crab meat inside. The crab meat was fresh and sweet. We also had the choice of dipping it into mustard which excited our tastebuds. Overall, this was a unique dish and we loved it.Barbecued eggplant glazed with honey misoI am not a fan of eggplants but this was pretty good. After scraping off some of the miso (as it was too salty for my liking), the eggplant was actually palatable! It was so soft it almost melted in the mouth and I loved the slight chargrilled taste. The honey miso made it a really appetising dish indeed.Grilled gamba carabinerosI was really excited to see gamba carabineros on the menu. Gamba carabineros are a type of Spanish red prawn and ever since I ate them in Barcelona, I could not stop thinking about them. Like the ones I had in Barcelona, these were simply grilled with sea salt. The prawn was sweet and fresh but not as fresh as the ones in Barcelona as the meat was not as firm. Still one of the better prawns in Singapore though! For gamba carabineros, you MUST eat the brain juice! According to the chef in Barcelona, that is the best part of the prawn and the reason why gamba carabineros are so highly prized. Do not worry though, for the juice is really sweet.Handmade mochi with peanut and green tea powderThe mochi was extremely soft and chewy, sweet but not cloying. I preferred dipping it into the green tea powder for a slight bitterness.Milk pudding with red beansThis dessert was disappointing. While the pudding was smooth, it lacked taste and the red beans were too dry to help. This left an unpleasant taste and texture in our mouth.SummaryCost: ~$580 for 2 people, with 4 alcoholic drinksFood: Excellent steak! You have to order the A5!!!Service: Polite but slightly slowAmbience: Romantic, counter seating recommendedDress code: Smart casualWill I recommend it? Definitely!","409":"Excellent food and service. We are all small tapas and took their recommendations. The atmosphere is great too. Little pricey, and you probably need reservations but worth it!","410":"Wasn't too bad or too good. Because it's popular you have a time limit to eat your meal . We tried 7 dishes and the one that really hit the mark was the scallop . You f you are a penny pincher then do not go . If you eat slow then do not go , if you enjoy good food and cocktails then it's a must !The photo shows squid ink paella , nice taste would order again","411":"Not sure I was too happy to pay $6 for four pieces of bread but other than that, the squid ink paella had robust flavors and would come back just for more of that.","412":"This Spanish tapas bar is on point. The food is fantastic, I wish I could've ordered the entire menu. The Jamon iberico ham was out of this world. The cocktails were fun and delicious!","413":"Reliably excellent, and always crowded. Have been here multiple times and I'd recommend the staples: gambas al ajillos, croquettas, jamon iberico, octopus and any of the paellas. Cocktails are reasonably priced and the wine list has a good variety of Spanish wines. Excellent service as well. Overall, this is probably the best place for tapas in Singapore.","414":"Outstanding! Each dish we had was phenomenal and the drink was icing on the cake. Fabulous and will be back!","415":"Who would have thunk it - Catalan cuisine in Singapore...my life is now repleat with fullness ;-) \u00a0They serve expertly crafted cocktails and Beautiful plates of tapas. \u00a0Croquettes, croquettes, croquettes...order scores ! \u00a0The Patatas bravas are a favorite of mine; these were just OK. \u00a0Cod balls are yet another favorite and these do not disappoint. \u00a0The Spanish octopus was tender and perfectly prepared.Three words, squid ink paella. \u00a0Do it. \u00a0Briny sea-worthy delight. \u00a0The ambiance is rhythmic, romantic, and plush :-)","416":"The food, throughout the night, did not disappoint. We had the croquette as a starter. Minus half a star for not having the foie gras slider when we visited last Friday. It was a dish I really wanted to try, but it was not available. We ordered beef slider, which was tasty, but I guess it was just that. The fried squid was definitely tasty, however, it came in small portion. The special of the day, cauliflower, was really good and crunchy. The fish and cheese (mac and cheese ball lookalike thing) was spot on. You gotta try this when you visit. Another highlight is the black squid ink paella. I could come back again just to have a paella to myself, if they are not so particular about the whole reservation sms and dining duration. The pork ribs were good, but not wow. Overall, everything we have ordered that night is above average. I would definitely be back to try more dishes. Minus another half a star for the pain of having to reserve on the phone with the missus who have hearing problem and make a fuss about replying \"confirmed\" by 3pm the next day and endless reminders that we have to leave by certain timing.","417":"We went here Saturday night at about 9pm, the restaurant was busy and the tunes were bumpin. Seriously, I was chair dancing the whole night. We went with tapas- let's be honest when given the choice why would you not, and loved EVERYTHING. We did the ham croquettes, beef cheek sliders, and saut\u00e9ed cauliflower. The ham croquettes may have been the best thing I've ever tasted. Pricing for food is fair, although the wine list gets pretty extravagant although for Singapore it seems fairly normal. Come here, you will not be disappointed.","418":"This place has a real NYC vibe for restaurants. Great tapas spot with food from Spain. The chef is a Michelin star chef and his food was legit. Staff was really nice like everyone in Singapore usually is. We ordered the lamb chops, beef sliders , cod fish balls, some mushroom dish and I forgot the last item. But everything was legit and tasted good. Would def come here again. I would suggest to def make a reservation. They book up quick as it is a trendy spot. Peace from Doctor P","419":"I asked my friend Ning when she would be free to celebrate her mid November bday..and she said let's do dinner this Thursday. She's busy with med school so she has to seize the day (evening). She said try FOC? I had heard of it but had thought another tapas bar ok whatever.Made bookings early..ok left a voice message to callback to add an additional person and they didn't call. FOCING service I thought to myself but I called back and they were helpful as can be. Thereafter, it was all uphill.We arrived just before 7pm on a Thurs night and the place was getting full. We hadn't asked but they had given us 3 girls counter seats on the leftmost side of the counter right in front of Chef Jordi. Getting to ask him about the food (even the ones not destined for us), watching him and the other staff hard at work, chatting about his recommendations and preferences really added to the experience.We had Croquetas de setas (Mushroom croquettes) $8. Cuatro unidades (4 units). Sorry the nod goes to Binomio on this one. The batter was slightly overfried (but the 4th piece which I did not eat was noticeably a shade lighter in colour than the other 3) and the inside was full of bites of (maybe?) porcini mushrooms. Tasty and mushroomy but Binomio wins for the smooth cream filling evenly exuding mushroom flavour. Both places seem to serve the croquestas on the same dab of garlic mayo..(incidentally the same garlic mayo dabbed on FOC's black rice paella and Binomio's squid ink pasta fideua).We had a daily special recommended by Chef, he called it the huevos dish and it was basically potato pieces fried with crispy edges served with an egg on top and in a skillet. Simple but again very yummy and perfectly seasoned (ie not too salty).One of Ning's and my favourites (Nadia doesn't like tomatoes) was the watermelon gazpacho with charcoal olive oil ice cream. We ordered one portion to share and Chef Jordi thoughtfully split the ice cream into 3 separate bowls. The gazpacho was incredibly smooth and tasty and tomatoey with just a touch of sweetness from the watermelon. Nadia doesn't like tomatoes (other than fresh ones in salad or in the background like pizza sauce) but she loved the icecream mixed with the gazpacho and ate up every last drop of her portion. That's how good it was.Food was very tasty without being cloyinging rich and greasy which can be the risk of Spanish restaurants (in Spain as well as here!). The black rice (arroz negro) with seafood paella $22 was luscious without visible separated oil unlike Binomio and La Bomba and Sabio). The plumpness and bite of the rice was perfect, really good quality rice handled well.Another strong recommendation by Chef Jordi, the grilled ribeye at $35 was meltingly tender and served medium rare. Originally I thought he was talking about the 1kg beef on the bone..and I asked \"Erm..too much for us 3?\". He said No! Just nice for sharing..(I was thinking OK..maybe we look very hungry) and later when I realised it was a ribeye steak portion PHEW I told him about the intiial misunderstanding and we had a good laugh about it. This was 150g and we were all commenting how tender and juicy and really good the meat was and my other 2 friends also raved on about the grilled peppers served on the side of it.Note on the cocktails. Nadia had the Smells Like Gin Spirit $14. Tasty and refreshing gin version of a mojito. I had the Chef's favourite, Bloody Jordi also $14 and is a bloody Mary type with an Asian sour twist. Looking at the description again that must be the Kimuchi no Moto (korean kimchi base). Dario the mixologist said it had 1.5 shots of tequila in it. I couldn't taste the alcohol but he said it was not meant to be a strong alcohol forward drink. It's true the spices and tomato was the prevalent sensation and not everyone will like that flavour combination but it was interesting to try something new. My friends all commented it was so savoury like a soup and it did go down very easily. I suppose it's a silent killer but I was happy to get on to the excellent house wine - I had the Angelitos Negros 2013 at $10.50 a glass!After all that Chef asked if we wanted a small bite each. He then prepared 3 pieces of scallops topped with their soy \"caviar\" (tapioca sago) so we could have 1 each when the standard serving is 2. Fresh juicy and plump w slight char $16.We went through the courses very smoothly (all tapas but felt like a proper dinner all the way) and happily ended with the chocolate burger at $12 and the Torrija $10. Overall food was fresh, not overstated, not over-seasoned, refreshing, very yummy but not bludgeoning on the palate. A small portion of Torrija with a candle and with happy birthday written in dulce de leche on the plate was served complimentary. And unexpectedly, even the valet (from Purple Valet) waited to close all our doors for us as we got into the car. I don't know if that's part of the restaurant training but kudos.","420":"Quite frankly, I am not sure why this restaurant averages 4+ stars on Yelp. Of all the dishes we had tonight, only the cauliflower and duck confit were good. Scallops came out completely raw in the middle...asparagus were overcooked to the point of being mushy...not to mention we were served the fibrous bottom. If you are going to serve the bottom of the asparagus, then you may want to shave it! Cuttlefish paella with saffron came out crunchy and looking completely brown and absent of any saffron. The rice was so undercooked and it tasted very muddled. I have never seen saffron flavored rice to be brown...why would you cover up the nice yellow color of saffron...maybe it's a false item in the description and none was ever used??? Beef cheek burger was okay and lamb chops were bland.","421":"Lucky to snatch a seat at the bar on a Thursday night.. always wanted to visit FOC, and the food didn't disappoint. Food is on the pricier side, although I think the clientele probably won't blink an eye at the price. Service is great, although, for some reason, the couple dishes I ordered came out a bit saltier than im used to. Maybe I'll ask for less salt next time.","422":"I get the hype.This place is buzzy (even on Mondays), with quirky decor, great music, and top notch food. The cocktail menu doesn't seem to end, and I love how they break it down by easily identifiable flavour profiles like refreshing, floral, and spirit driven. I tried the Lord Sidecar- loved the sage and it was a great starter for a hot and humid day.I was surprised at the patatas bravas- their rendition had a saucy kick to it. The grilled foie gras sliders were very rich, definitely a treat meant to be filed under \"sometimes food only\"! My husband and I were also impressed with the Black Mediterranean Squid Ink Paella. A mouthful to say, but when that mouthful's in your mouth, it's damn shiok.My only constructive feedback was that it was slightly warm where we were sitting. We were at the end table opposite the bar\/kitchen. I noticed we weren't that far from the ceiling AC unit; not sure if it was on at all.","423":"Been to FOC twice. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Plates are sometimes removed quite quickly but then again you want the space for the next dish. The food is amazing! Hands down. Dishes are well presented and are inviting to look at while having a conversation.If you have the choice, sit at the bar. It makes the experience all the more intense and inspiring as you see all the different things the kitchen staff prepares. And they look amazing.We had (in no particular order): oysters (daily special), beef cheek (special), scallops, peppers, bread with tomatoes (OMG!). In terms of drinks you should try the Bloody Jordi - a slimmed down house special version of a Bloody Mary. It's good, it's really good :)On a personal note: For me a great restaurant is not only about service and food. It's what they do to encourage you back. First time around a had mixup on my bill that I only claimed later. FOC staff was really really helpful and things were resolved to satisfaction in no time. No hard time, no stalling. I will be back at FOC. Worth your time and every penny spent!Thank you FOC :)","424":"Been to FOC@ Hong Kong Street several times. In general, the food is excellent, especially the squid ink paella, as well as the desserts. Alcoholic drinks on menu are also very good; I think this place has one of the best pisco sours I have had in Singapore. But, the seats are too close to each other, and the acoustics of the place is horrible. It is difficult to hear conversations at the table.","425":"There's a blazing fire that is out to turn up the heat on Hongkong Street and that is FOC Restaurant, a new Spanish dining concept and cocktail bar. FOC is an inspired collaboration between Michelin-starred Chef Nandu Jubany, Chef Jordi Noguera formerly from FoodBar Dada, and award-winning mixologist Dario Knox previously from Catalunya Restaurant. Yes it's a star studded team!Expect a contemporary small plates menu with Catalan and Mediterranean influences, complemented by a selection of inventive cocktails. They even created a selection of Asian inspired tapas which were honestly pretty darn good.HITS!Cochifrito. Crispy Pork Taco ($14\/2pcs). This is one of my favorites if not the top favorite dish. This is FOC's take on the Mexican taco, and that crispy shell was too addictive. It's like a really awesome fried wanton skin filled with tender pulled pork. I really liked the crispy pulled pork. I didn't even mind the dou miao and I don't even like bean sprouts. Now could we have this in jumbo size or what?Bocata de foie-gras a la brasa y shitake marinado. Grilled foie-gras with marinated shitake and green apple ($22\/2pcs). Loved that broiche bun with a glossy blistered exterior. It was very crunchy and extremely buttery. Even though the foie gras was on the oily side, it had a nice creamy texture and i liked that the green apples added that tinge of tartness.FOC Hamburguesa de chocolate FOC chocolate burger ($12). Now here is one carefully crafted dessert burger made from white chocolate, vanilla mousse, strawberries and mint leaves. You should eat it all together for a balanced review of this dessert. The combined flavors of the smoky caramel, sweet milk chocolate and the tart strawberries were delightful. The cream in the 'bun' had a marshmallow texture too!DRINKS! Innovative, strong and very affordable! They start at $13 and cocktails are available ALL DAY. Say WERTTTT!MISSESVieiras con caviar de soja. Scallops soy caviar ($20). It's scallops, and it's nicely seared and it's in a salty soy. There's really nothing else to it.\"Cansalada\" confitada con pure de coliflor. Confited pork belly with cauliflower puree ($14\/4pcs). Bland. Fatty. Bleah. Give me that cauliflower puree on its own.","426":"I came here with my family during our Singapore trip. We had some laksa earlier that morning, but my brother was super adamant about going to FOC for lunch. The decor was pretty cool - some weird light sculptures in the back. My nephew was quite fascinated by them.The service was impeccable. Our waiter was super awesome.The food was equally awesome. We ordered the following things: Ham croquette, octopus Galican style, squid ink paella, grilled Iberico pork ribs, pork belly & cauliflower puree, cod fish fritters, grilled scallops with soy caviar, foie gras sliders. Honestly, everything was really good. Highly recommend the squid ink paella!","427":"Great cocktails and great food. Do try their crackling pork and their paella. Superb! Rsvp is a must eventhough it's for weekdays .","428":"One of the best dinners I've had in Singapore. Service was flawless, food was amazing. Worth every cent. Great for a fun night out when you're in the mood to splurge a little. Total bill for 2 came up to $115 (incl. GST & service charge) without drinks.We had:- Mushroom croquettes ($10 for 4). Served fresh, each croquette can be finished off in 2 delightful bites. The inside is a gooey mess of cheese, cream and mushrooms. Wonderful starter to whet your appetite.- Squid ink paella ($26). Perfect for sharing, also gorgeously photogenic. Each grain of rice was plump and flavorful and mixed with hidden octopus chunks, which was a pleasant surprise. It was topped with juicy prawns and clams and dollops of aioli. We wiped the pan clean. I must confess I never was a fan of paellas, but this one hit the ball out of the park. - Grilled octopus ($22). Juicy octopus nestled on a bed of flavorful mashed potato topped with paprika. Only minor gripe was that some parts were so charred that I ended up tasting more bitterness from the burnt bits than the actual octopus. The octopus itself, on the other hand, was tender and meaty. Absolutely delicious. - Iberico pork ribs & pumpkin mash ($30). Our least favorite dish of the night. Perhaps also because we were getting pretty full by then and this dish ended up feeling too heavy. The ribs were very fatty and the savory pork didn't go that well with the sweet pumpkin. It was decent on the whole though. - Chocolate Galaxy ($12). They bring the chocolate dome to the table and pour hot chocolate syrup over it on front of you, so you watch as the chocolate shell melts to reveal 3 mini profiteroles within. Ended up being essentially a chocolate \"soup\" with 3 cream-filled profiteroles. We didn't think we would be able to finish it, but we did! There were crunchy bits at the bottom which was a nice touch. Great for sharing.Didn't manage to try this time, but I've also heard good things about the mini chocolate burger and the watermelon gazpacho. Will definitely return! Love this restaurant :)","429":"Food was not as good as before. \u00a0E.g., prawns were cooked too much and octopus lost its unique texture. \u00a0Staff, serving a black ink paella, advised us to be careful as the pan was very hot but it turned out to be almost cold. \u00a0Hahaha... it was served too late. :-( However, I was pretty satisfied with wine selection and overall ambience. Will I visit again? Not sure...","430":"Craft cocktails and small plates with a Western theme? \u00a0Come to mama.They impressed me when I walked in the door, the hostess squeezing me in on the spot despite no real opening for quite awhile. \u00a0The waitstaff was fantastic all around.The cozy atmosphere, the view of the kitchen and bar, and the hustling of the staff gave the place quite a bit of positive energy. \u00a0The eclectic decor included a couple of large colorful busts looking down which was vaguely reminiscent of Carnival.Quite a range of libations, I did sample a couple. \u00a0I was honestly a bit disappointed with the \"Smells Like Gin Spirit\"--I was hoping for a cocktail like an Aviation but got something I'd expect at a New Orleans Sno-Ball stand instead. \u00a0Perhaps fitting for a balmy Singapore evening, though. \u00a0The Don Martinez, however, was smoking (on many levels)--tequila-based deliciousness.An extensive selection of Spanish themed tapas that you would expect adorned the menu. \u00a0I'm sure they are delicious, but I went for the \"World Tapas\" instead. \u00a0Delicate scallops, pulled pork mini-tacos, and beef-cheek sliders. \u00a0Every item I ate, they completely nailed.I loved the dessert \"burger\". \u00a0I'll admit that when I first saw a picture I thought it a bit contrived and scoffed at the notion, but decided to try it anyway. \u00a0It was so cute--the delicateness of the dish made it more reminiscent of a toddler's toy cheeseburger rather than a slider. \u00a0Strawberry \"tomato\" and mint \"lettuce\" added to the effect. \u00a0A nice thin chocolate shell crunch with a light creamy filling, it was pleasing to the palate as well as the eye. \u00a0Bravo.","431":"We had five dishes. - baby squid w\/aioli- scallops- pulled pork sliders- pork belly and cauliflower - foie gras slidersAbsolutely love the sous-vide pork belly and creamy cauliflower pur\u00e9e dish. Cant stop thinking about the playful foie gras and shiitake sliders or the buttery pulled pork buns.Scallops were good, but slightly overlook from the ponzu. Skip the baby squid. The batter on the squids were thick and made it heavy.","432":"Delicious food and great service for Singapore. The portions are very precious but the food is flavorful and well-prepared. I will gladly return.","433":"I had one of the best vacations a couple of years ago, cycling around the Catalan region eating affordable and excellent food everywhere. From Michelin-starred restaurants (which I'm not sure is the best way to assess the more traditional dishes, but then again this region was under French protection at one point ) to a home kitchen, the food in Catalunya is fantastic. If food was reason alone for granting autonomy, I say why not! Anyway, let's leave the politics aside and talk about FOC. I didn't visit Can Jubany in Osona but I bet FOC is equally good. Spanish food by the Spanish, not too pricey and portions were sufficient (here's looking at you, Serenity). I was craving some fideu\u00e0, which is like the ang moh version of hokkien prawn mee...and the chef gamely obliged with his rendition of squid ink fideu\u00e0. It was very tasty with a good amount of wok hei! We also had the croquettes, which had mashed potatoes so mashed it was practically a mouth-watering puree; sardines with pickles 9gives your palate a good puckering up), fresh and very sweet tomatoes, the potatas bravas (kinda skimpy on the seasoning and not greasy...which I kind of associate with the dish but hey this will do) and the battered cod fish balls with apple puree (interesting but kind of mushy with not too distinctive flavors i.e. I couldn't tell it was cod). Up to this point, the food came out at a steady pace and then we had a long wait. I checked on the waiter and realized the kitchen had forgotten our grilled octopus and the egg with pork belly and truffle special...while the clock was ticking on when we had to vacate our seats because of the two cover policy and because I had a show to catch at the Art House. The octopus was served shortly and much as I had hyped up my dining partner on the wonders of Spanish octopuses (they are in fact ridiculously taught, smoky, crisp and mind blowing), the FOC version kind of disappointed. Time in the Josper grill somehow robbed the octopus of its juices, though I liked the char on top, so this was an \"ehhh\" dish that could've been so much better. The eggs with pork belly and truffles (what a combo right) never came and I think I actually paid for it in my haste. I didn't check the bill thoroughly but on hindsight at $180 and some quick math off the website, I think I was charged for the dish that never went into my belly even though I would've loved to taste it.Finally a note on the cocktails. I had the cuzco sour...because if you've hiked all over Peru you would have romantic memories of this lovely drink (not so much of the chicha). It was very balanced - the right amount of tart lime\/lemon and the requisite egg whites and bitters on top. My second drink was a Bangkok something, which I asked the waiter to recommend based on my preference for something \"refreshing\". It ended up being almost exactly the same as the sour except for some supposed chilli's that were mild to non-existent. Maybe I'm being a little picky but the mark of front of house would be one that watches both your food and drink selections and offers pairings that work with the food or takes you in a different direction from your first. I felt the team fell short here though it's not surprising given how busy the restaurant was.Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal at FOC, probably because the food and drinks came soon enough that I was willing to over look the slow service towards the end and the incorrect billing.","434":"From start to finish, every item was perfectly executed. Cocktails were also amazing, but very small for the price.","435":"Flawless meal and one of the best I've had in Singapore. If you can, try to sit at the bar so you can watch in awe as the chefs prepare plates and the bartenders make drinks.What I had:Pork Tacos: When they first arrived, I was surprised at how small they were, but as soon as I took the first bite, I no longer wished for anything bigger. There was so much flavour packed into these little bite sized tacos, I'm still craving them a day later. Potatoes Bravos: Delicious and delicate. A perfect starter that will not fill you up, but will make you anxiously await your next plate.Grilled Octopus: wow. All I can say is wow. Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, with a perfect char. I've had quite a bit of octopus and this rivals the best I've had. French Toast and Ice Cream dessert: How can you go wrong with this, it's a perfectly sweet dessert that isn't too sweet and not too heavy. A great way to finish a great meal. Smells Like Gin Spirit: I was hoping for a nice refreshing cocktail and that's exactly what I got. I'm not much of a gin guy but decided to try this out and was pleasantly surprised.","436":"Amazing place, never thought there would be a place like this in my home town of Singapore. \u00a0I've been a fan of good tapas since my Movida experience in Melbourne, and so those familiar with that place, we have our very own cool tapas bar on our own door step now.Its been almost a week since I've been there, and I still remember the dishes I had. \u00a0The suckling pig is not something they have everyday, if they have it on the menu the day you are there, have it. \u00a0I can't name many occasions when pork has melted in my mouth!The anchovies on coca bread is a must try, as is the braised beef. \u00a0And that Foie Gras, you want that flavor to stay in your mouth forever. Here's my other recommendation, if you're in small group, ask to sit at the bar. \u00a0Its not only about watching the cocktails being served up, but also watching the chef and ESC prepare all the dishes in the kitchen. \u00a0Its certainly part of the experience.","437":"For a new-ish restaurant, FOC is already running like a well-oiled establishment. The staff knew the menu inside-out, so they were able to make spot-on recommendations; the arrival of our courses were timely; and our water glasses were kept topped up with big smiles.As for the Catalan food at FOC, it was indeed superb - traditional but executed with an effortless flair so while dishes seldom deviate from the classics, flavours are rich, hearty and soulful. It's pricey, but no more expensive than any other Spanish restaurants aroundWe had:1) Heuvos Estrellados con Chorizo ($10) - a breakfast hash of fried potatoes, chorizo balls and a just-cracked egg, still sizzling on the hotplate: Smoosh it all together, and you get a glorious mess of runny eggy delight. Our favourite tapas here.2) Croquetas de Setas con Jamon ($10 for 4): a mixed platter of mushroom croquettes and Spanish ham croquettes, bursting with creamy goodness, and tempered with the contrast of the soft mash and crunchy breadcrumbed coat.3) Tortilla Abierta con Trufa y Pimientos del Piquillo ($26): an open tortilla with blistered red peppers, truffle strips and aioli was simple but done fantastically. It was just the right balance of rich aioli, aromatic truffle, sweet peppers and eggy pancake.4) Gambas al Ajillo ($18): a classic of sauteed prawns in white wine and garlic, notable for 2 things: the copious use of really good white wine, which made this the most heady rendition ever - I think I got a little high from this; and incredibly sweet prawns still with shells on, for maximum flavour infusion to the sauce. A tip: get bread to mop all the deliciousness up.5) Vieiras a la Brasa con Caldo de Bonito y Caviar de Soja ($16): a couple of fat succulent scallops grilled to a beautiful caramelization, and dunked into a delicate bonito stock and topped with soy beads. Great fusion of Asian flavours6) Costillas de Cerdo a la Brasa con Pure de Calabaza Ahumada ($30): seriously good, premium iberico pork ribs, burnished with rosemary, were grilled to a juicy smoky finish, and sided by a smoked pumpkin puree.7) Arroz Negro con Mariscos y \"All I Oli\" ($24): perhaps the best squid ink paella I've ever had. The moreish squid ink was nuanced and countered with the creamy bite of aioli. You can't quite see it, but there was as much rice as there was squid dice, so that's really amazingly generous.","438":"It's a smallish place but with a confident attitude about it. The cocktail list was never ending and I tried a couple they were both excellent! The Tapas was very nice as well, bcoz we had a few vegetarians in the group we stuck to mostly vegetarian and still I loved it, the cheese platter was excellent. Overall a good lace to go again. But it's not cheap!","439":"This little restaurant and bar was a surprise to find in Singapore. The service was beyond exceptional and the food was fantastic. My favorite was the beef sliders with kimchi.","440":"Had dinner here on a Friday on a reservation made 2 weeks earlier. Was expecting another overrated tapas place but was pleasantly surprised. The winners for me were the beef cheek sandwich, patatas bravas and crispy pork tacos. Would have loved to try their scallop ceviche with guacamole and grilled scallop but both weren't available. Finished off with the tarta tatin done with a modern twist which was agreeable with me.They have an interesting, well priced and fairly extensive cocktail menu complete with a taste guide. Alas, the cocktail itself was very average. Had the red sangria which tasted rather like grape juice with added sugar. The service here deserves commendation. Efficient and smiley, a rarity in SG. I will be back.","441":"We went to dinner here on a Friday night. \u00a0The decor is cool, hip, feels like a trendy bar\/tapas place in Manhattan. \u00a0We started with a cocktail that was excellent (probably the best I have had in Singapore) - Smells Like Gin Spirit - which was a perfect start-off-the-night cocktail as it was herby and refreshing. \u00a0Hubby had the special gin and tonic which he really liked. \u00a0We had 5 or so tapas. \u00a0Our favorites were the toasted bread and tomatoes and croquettas - classic that are hard to do wrong, but were both very good. \u00a0The black paella was only okay - honestly, the paella at Pasar Bella is better. \u00a0The french toast for desert was very good - carmelized, chewy french toast with vanilla ice cream - and a great way to end the night. \u00a0I will be back but might make it a cocktails and a couple of starters thing, versus an entire night as there are just so many places to try in Singapore.","442":"I feel a little self-conscious, giving FOC only three stars amidst all the 4-5 star reviews so far.The bad first, since it weighs heavily on my mind. I hate that they do two sittings, one at 6:30pm and the other at like... 9. It's ridiculous. Some of us work till 7 ish, 8, and there's no way we can wait till 9 to have dinner. So the only time I've eaten at FOC is for a work dinner, when the entire office got off work early, just so we could eat here. Other than with such special arrangements? I'm basically never going to be able to dine here on a weekday.The food was... good. Not mind-blowing. Not amazing. Just... good. And not even enthusiastically good. Granted, I didn't order items off the menu, we had a pre-ordered selection of the menu because we were such a big group, but I think we hit many of the popular items. The octopus was good, but not the best, or second best I've had in Singapore. The eggs scrambled at the table with fried potatoes, brilliant idea, but the hot-plate wasn't hot enough to actually cook the eggs, so we had very raw egg white, slightly cooked egg-yolk, and brilliantly crisp potato bits. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and very addictive, and I'd definitely order it again... if I do go back. The seafood paella was popular with some, though the seafood taste got a bit overpowering by the 4-5 spoonful. Mushroom croquettas? Brilliant. Creamy, practically fall apart croquettas with a strong distinct mushroom taste. Really good. But better than a good creamy jamon croquetta? Unfortunately... no.So maybe you'll enjoy FOC more than I did if you're a fan of cocktails. I didn't order any because I was driving, and was having wine. But right now, I'd rather head to UNA for my tapas fix.","443":"This is where spa aired come to eat so.... That's all said try chaparillo. \u00a0 arros negre and the wines .","444":"Perfect place for intetactive eating. Definitely want to get a reservation. Try for the group tables. You never know who you might meet.","445":"It's interesting to see what passes for tapas in Singapore, but FOC really nails it down with some excellent selection of very unique plates as well as the classics. \u00a0We actually just left the ordering to our server who planned the following dishes: Jamon Iberico, Scallops with soy caviar and bonito stock, beef cheek sliders, and slow cooked octopus. \u00a0We really appreciated the thicker slices of jamon iberico, which allows one to fully savor the cured ham. \u00a0The scallops were outstanding and totally worth the price of $18 for a pair. \u00a0The beef cheek sliders was my least fave - very good flavor but not a big fan of the texture. \u00a0And I loved how the octopus was paired with some earthy potato. \u00a0I will definitely come back to try some of the classic tapas,but the first visit was definitely solid. \u00a0Their bar program is also way above average for a restaurant with some really interesting house cocktails. \u00a0But I tend to stick with the classics, and I was very happy with the Americano made with Amer Picon. \u00a0The place gets packed, and with good reason. \u00a0Definitely a fun place that also takes their food and drinks seriously. \u00a0The small plates can definitely add up but it's also well worth the price.","446":"This restaurant is just awesome! Where do I start? First of all - its a good idea to reserve a table or seats. Depending if you are interested to see how they make the food or if you just want to sit and relax with your friends. The decor is cool - reminds me of the cool kid clubs in Berlin - and the service awesome. The food: You might want to go for exercise before you enter the sinful temple of culinary highlights - as you will most likely eat more than usual because its just so good. Usually I sit at the bar and let the boss decide what he is going to serve me as so far - he never disappointed. From the gazpacho to the clams over the chorizo to the creme catalan (which is a MUST HAVE!!) everything is just amazing. I have been to Barcelona and never had such amazing tapas. The way the food is combined - the flavours, the consistency and structure is very different, surprising and every time like a food symphony. \u00a0What I personally like is that the way the spices are used is so balanced that I don't need to put on extra salt or any other sauce. For me that means that a dish is perfect and that is extraordinary. Drinks: Their wine and beer selection is quite good but I normally stick to my two favourite cocktails: Old Fashion Churchill and Bloody Jordy (which - if you like body mary - is a MUST HAVE TOO!!). Last but not least - I went there once with a colleague who is vegetarian - and even for him there was a lot of choice and he really enjoyed the food too. I will keep coming back. The prices are reasonable for this kind of haute cuisine. Simply a great restaurant!","447":"After all the buzz, the reality was disappointing. The chef seems to love to put huge amounts of salt on everything. We sent the cod back because it was so salty that it was not edible. When the lamb arrived equally as salty, we just gave up and left half of it untouched.","448":"The restaurant is located at the far end of the building, with a unblock view of the merlion and Marina Bay Sands. The place was very stylish decorated with a cozy and old school feel. Currently the restaurant was having a promotion for Flavours of The Fullerton Heritage 2016. A 3 course set lunch for this promotion cost $35++ and available everyday.I was served iced water but it was not refilled regularly. The meal was started with amuse bouche and bread. The amuse bouche was a creamy truffle mousse, topped with crispy rice, which pop in the mouth. The bread was soft and warm, served with thin sliver slices of cheese.Appetizer : Burrata CheeseMango Olive Tapenade, Parma Ham, Rosemary FoamThe cheese was light and soft like tofu, where one can slice easily with just the fork. The olive mixture added a punch to the slightly bland dish.Main : Tagliatelle alla BologneseKagoshima Wagyu Beef Ragout, Parmigiano ReggianoThe handmade pasta was soft and tender. The dish was served pipping hot. Looked simple but it was delicious and very filling.Dessert : Coconut Panna CottaPassion Fruit Sauce, White Mango Compote, Mango TuilesThe dessert was light and tangy, without too creamy.Overall the food was great and filling too. However I was quite disappointed with its service. I had not finished my amuse bouche when I was served the Appetizer course. Turned out that there was a wedding dinner that night. The staffs were rushing the lunch crowd, so that they could start to prepare for the dinner. I wish that I had been informed when I placed my order. I felt kind of being rushed through the meal.","449":"Disappointing after a decent start. We will not be returning. Overpriced for what it was","450":"Romantic ambience with a great view of the marina area. Service was attentive and presentable. The appetizer bread was served with generous shaved cheese. Thick seabass fillet and wagyu beef that melts in you mouth, went down well with glass of champagne and reds. Long black was perfect to close the evening with choc lava. An exceptional evening.","451":"Disappointing! \u00a0...and overpriced for what it is. Let's start from the good part: \u00a0the view, the venue, the location. And the bread. After the bread, it went downhill.Maybe when Chef Forlino was there it was worth it. Now they lost it. Will go back to No Menu...","452":"Disappointing dining experience. It was our first time and our last time at Forlino.The bar area was a sad dark corner opposite the restroom; we waited there for friends to join and had some cocktails. The Americano and Negroni were tasteless and watery.The service was absent and unpassionate. One did not get a sense of pride of the history of this restaurant which has had such a wonderful past.Appetisers: pretty good: cold cuts, burrata, and scallop tartar (not quite Italian though).Main courses: big disappointment: The Coniglioni with Duck ragu came over-baked and therefore the pasta shells were hard and tough to chew. The duck ragu was slightly too sweet.Risotto with shrimp: average.Spaghetti carbonara: too creamy and lacked the authentic flavor of a true carbonaraBranzino: small portion served in an uninspiring manner with tired vegetables around it.A great positive: The views are wonderful.Overall however, a tired, uninspiring and very overpriced dining experience with poor execution of Italian dishes ($150+ per person with one bottle of wine).","453":"Came here for lunch. I really liked the view, and the setup is really nice and clean. Service was average, staff seemed a unfriendly when we made requests, but remained polite. I was vegetarian that day, and just wanted to check what dishes did not have meat. Staff did not seem sure.Anyway, I liked the bread, even though it was rather oily. Everything else all right - nothing bad - but boring. Ever had a meal where you cannot find much fault, but that's the only great thing? Pretty much sums this meal up. If I had to pick something though, I think I liked the panna cotta w\/ passion fruit best. Slightly sour, but otherwise good. Overall, it felt like I was there more for the view and to have a chat, and the meal was an add-on\/ \u00a0secondary to that and was no cause for interruption.","454":"Forlino is one of those restaurants that thrives on business clientele and ladies who lunch. It fits the mold of a perfunctory fine dining restaurant with it's white linen, sharply dressed waiters and a hostess at the front desk with a remarkable memory. Thing is while the food is good and the service is as it should be for people who lunch in 45 minutes, I feel like this restaurant lacks heart or passion and that's why it scores a 3\/5. At a recent lunch, I had the crab salad to start with and a seafood casserole for my mains. I believe the menu changes monthly with the seasons so these items may not be available year round. The crab salad was light and refreshing with a mold of fresh, juicy crab and just enough dressing drizzled on the plate. My seafood casserole was deceptively filling, served in a cast iron pan. I had pieces of cod, lobster, mussels and other treasures from the sea, cooked perfectly in a tomato base. Before my orders came, we were given a plate of cheese shavings and bread, both of which were extremely addictive and threatened to ruin my meal. In all, I can't complain about the food, decor and view but the restaurant lacks a certain je ne sais quoi. I would return again for work lunches but wouldn't make the special trip out on a weekend.","455":"Came here for a weekday lunch. Friends had told me this was only so-so, and I agree.Good things first. The focaccia bread was served up warm and soft, though the bakers leaned towards the liberal side with the olive oil. For mains I had the halibut filet, which the waiter recommended over the veal. It was crisply seared and succulent inside, and fresh.However, that was the only high note. The rest of the meal was technically alright but singularly uninspired.The starter, two small slices of raw salmon with pesto, was decent but not memorable. Our second course of pasta - garganelli with forest mushrooms - was better, but I didn't feel compelled to finish it. The pannacotta dessert that followed was monotonous and yawn-inducing.The sugar biscuits they served with tea\/coffee after were a tad more interesting, but not compelling enough to save this.","456":"I went there during the Restaurant Week on 1 Nov. This is the only restaurant that live up to my expectation during this Restaurant Week experience. They really prepared their best though we were paying half the price of their normal menu.Black Ink Fettuccine was on the menu that night. It was well executed :)","457":"You're always guaranteed to have a pleasant experience here. Excellent food and very good service in an elegant atmosphere. For starters, I recommend splitting the 'Dream' (S188++) with a partner: so decadent but how delicious - cold angel hair pasta with prawn, oyster, scallop, uni and caviar! Having the dish on your own would be too rich for most people. Classical dishes like osso bucco and veal milanesa are prepared to perfection here; the former melts in your mouth, the latter is juicy with very light 'batter'. Pricey, but still cheaper than the top Japanese restaurants!","458":"We dropped in as most of the eateries in our neighbourhood had closed for business by 9:30 pm - Garibaldi seems to be one of very few places open late.The staff was very friendly and courteous, we were asked to have a drink in the bar area whilst a table was set for us.When our table was ready we were taken to the main dining area which has a very calming atmosphere, with white and light coloured wood being predominant - complete with curtains to draw out the outside noises and lights. Our waiter introduced us to the set-menu, five courses with coffee, all truffle-themed for 188 S$ per person. It sounded great but we did not want to eat all that much - and spend a little less on dinner.We decided to go with half a dozen oysters (Australia & NZ), shared a scallop\/white truffles pasta starter and had pan roasted sea bass with vegetables as main.The food was delicious, the oysters fresh and very tasty, the pasta with scallops cooked to perfection and with the fresh truffle shavings just divine.The fish had a nice crispy skin and the meat was just perfect both in terms of texture and flavour.We had chosen a Sauvignon blanc\/Semillon from Australia to go with the food, which was lovely and at 88 S$ one of the cheapest choices on the extensive and expensive wine list. We found that the wine in general was overpriced but since we hadn't splurged on food for some time we decided to treat us to it - this however being the reason for 4 stars instead of five, as it really blew us away.Service was very good and professional, and consistent throughout which has become somewhat of a rarity these days, unfortunately.This place is perfect if a celebration is in order - actually there were two local parties celebrating a birthday complete with cake and candles :-).We will certainly be back some day for their excellent Italian food (the executive chef is Italian) and perfect service.","459":"Great food and service, and not really expensive for Singapore prices if you stay away from the caviar :) I had the lobster linguine which was exquisite, really a full whole lobster. $68++ Also ordered the antipasti set, which gives you a sampling of 6 different appetizers. $38++ My partner had the carbonara penne, which was also very good. Authentic cheese and real high quality smoked bacon (not your ordinary kind) I think the lunch set menu is also really reasonable, I think something around $40 and looks like a good deal.","460":"A fancy place with 5-star service and delicious Italian food? Yup, that's exactly what this place is! From the moment we entered, we were greeted with a jovial waiter and a complimentary plate of cheese and olives as we waited for our table to be ready. Just a few minutes later we were guided to our table and sent a complimentary appetizer and some of the best bread I've ever had. I had the fettuccini pomodoro and my husband had the veal and mushroom ravioli. We really enjoyed both and though we won't be coming here all the time (it's a bit expensive), this spot is perfect for a romantic night out.","461":"Restaurant week dinner -appetizer. Fois gras with fusion flacked that didn't work. Pineapple compote and pandan chiffon cake bits should not appear with fois. \u00a0+tagliatelle duck ragu. Not bad. Big portion. Expected a bit more al debate+roasted cod. V nice-dessert was an afterthought. Strange flavor combo. -decor reminds me of higher end ikea. Too modern Not sure if I'd return even if I know the chef","462":"What a gem.\u00a0 Pretty high end Italian place.\u00a0 Pretty formal old school cooking.\u00a0 The portions were pretty good sized.\u00a0 The staff is responsive, the food fast, and very good.\u00a0 I had the lamb...very good tasting.\u00a0 However, it left my stomach upset.\u00a0 It might have been how rich the food was, or how rare the meat was served.Wine list is great here is you have the money to spend.\u00a0 Lots of good wines to try for any group.We had to ask for the bill. \u00a0Service was not attentive at times.","463":"Garibaldi is one of my favorites. It's pricy so I don't go as often as I would like. But the food has always been very good and the service friendly and professional. This evening we decided to go with the executive dinner. 5 courses with a beautiful prosecco as an aperitif. The food was excellent as usual with new flavor combinations that were fantastic. Highly recommended for special occasions or to impress a special person.","464":"Came here for my Birthday and had a great time! Have always known that they were famous for their food - but I've never really got the chance to come. Am glad I kept it for my Birthday!What I Loved: The decor is nice. Service is really good too. We sat at the bar area - at one of the tables - as we wanted to have drinks and finger food. The staff paid quite a lot of attention to us. I ordered an Apricot Brandy & 7-Up which was great. For our finger food, we got the Bruschetta al Pomodoro & Calamari. My fave was the dessert, Tortino Caldo al Cioccolato ($18), Molten Lava Chocolate Cake with Hazelnut Gelato & Raspberry Coulis.What I Don't Love: The prices are pretty rough though. Just finger food, 3-4 drinks & dessert came up to like $138? But it's a pretty high end place so that's expected.","465":"This Italian restaurant is good, but oh-so-pricey. \u00a0We enjoyed the dishes we had, extremely authentic, but small portions. The also have a huge selection of wines by the half bottles which is much appreciated and their free bread is good.But when the bill came, it was around the same price as Mozza, and it just didn't blow us away, so I think I'll head to Marina Bay Sands next time.","466":"Pour quoi does Garibaldi even exist? Especially when competition is rife with Gunther's down the street? Well, I went one day as Gunther's was fully reserved and AMEX concierge suggested Garibaldi. The place was 3\/4 full on a Friday night.Food \u00a0was lackluster. Perhaps because my taste buds are not evolved enough? I can't even remember what I ate! Service was polite, swift and sterile, albeit lacking a touch of attentiveness that is expected.","467":"Garibaldi is known as one of Singapore's finest Italian restaurant and it is believable with its elegant fa\u00e7ade and fine dining setting. The menu entices people with its authentic Italian cuisine and ingredients that have been imported from Italy. I tried 2 dishes there, both of which I am very satisfied with - Osso Buco Con Risotto (braised veal shank with saffron risotto) and Linguine with Crabmeat and Vodka Sauce. The spaghetti was marvelous, proving the high standards of this Italian restaurant as the pasta was cooked to al dente and tossed in a flavorsome tomato-based sauce with a touch of alcohol. The Osso Buco Con Risotto stole the show, with the braised veal shank so tender and succulent. The creamy and rich risotto perfectly complemented the savory veal. The standards of this restaurant are heightened by its impeccable service. The staff was warm and friendly, and not to say attentive and accommodating when taking our orders.","468":"High-end modern Italian food which is yummy . \u00a0Excellent service and nice ambience. \u00a0On the pricey side. Good for groups and romantic dates. \u00a0Value for money lunch sets options available for weekday. \u00a0 My duck ragout pasta was fabulous!","469":"Fine Italian dining. Sophisticated dishes in a modern European ambience. I had the linguine with sea urchin - absolutely divine in its blend of favors, creaminess from the uni. The crackling pork was also wonderful. \u00a0Portions are small, but that's normal for high end European dining. Impressive wine list. \u00a0But - it's expensive, as the other reviewers note. Expect to pay $250-300 per person including good wines.","470":"New business in the area! Replacing Cedele (moved to punggol waterway) in the same spot opposite My Village shopping centre. I've not eaten the claypot rice at geylang before so am not able to make a comparison. You have to pre-order the claypot rice before you reach the place so that you can skip the 30 mins wait of preparation. hmmmm thats kinda troublesome to me. Teh! The claypot rice comes in 2 sizes. Small $18, good for 2 \u00a0& large $28 good for 4. The server will ask if you would like to mix the salted fish and dark soy sauce while he mix the rice. Traditionally, salted fish is added in for a smoked fragrant. It might look intimidating to some because it looks like a piece of stale meat. The claypot rice is really good! The chicken & chinese sausage portion is generous, in comparison, the few strands of choy sim on top of it looks pathetic. Anyway i think its for plating purpose. If you would like to add more vegs, they have many choices on their menu. We had nai bai with fried enoki, tofu with prawn & salted veg duck soup. The veg & tofu are ok.. I didnt like the salted veg duck soup. Its too salty for me & doesnt go well with the rice. It should go well with plain rice. There isnt a crowd during lunch. The servers are attentive to the extent that whenever someone dropped their chopsticks, they rushed to us. The shape of the bowls that they are using should be changed! It doesnt hold the chopsticks well and it rolls off our table. But they look chic for ... claypot rice. I will return for lunch as its air conditioned & water is served. Not too bad to hide from the heat. Hmm yes, gst + service charge. Total bill: $97.60 for 6 of us.","471":"The stall lights were off and the auntie was scrubbing the aluminium chwee kueh moulds. Perhaps guessing that we were wandering around her stall looking for other food options, the auntie asked, \"You want some? Still got lehSo we happily ordered the Ghim Moh Chwee Kway from the couple who has been running this chwee kueh stall since 1959. It is no wonder they have become a household name in Ghim Moh.The husband-and-wife team wake up in the wee hours to start making the chwee kueh by hands, not machines. However, the main difference between this chwee kuey and Tiong Bahru or even Bedok ones is the chye poh (preserved radish). Ghim Moh's ones ($2.40 for 8pcs) are super salty. No sesame seeds, no sugar. The preserved radish is stir-fried with pork lard and garlic, making it extra fragrant. They are undeniably oily, but I like. I thought the auntie was stingy on the chye poh...as they are really very very little (teochew ah pa says that the uncle tends to give toppings more generously then the auntie). But I think auntie knows it best.  A little really goes a long way.","472":"There are not many places that sell chwee kueh, finding a good one is even harder.My all time favourite stall was at Zhujiao Market (Tekka Market) but the stallholder closed shop when the renovation started. That was years ago.So I eat what I think is next best which is from this stall.Prices have gone up quite a lot since the market reopened. \u00a0I vaguely remember $1.00 for 4 and it's now $1.40 for 4. But it is not so saltish nowadays. Maybe the price of salt went up!Texture is still quite good.Ask them to go easy on scooping the oil when they scoop out the chye poh (salted radish).","473":"Very yummy Chwee Kueh, savory fragrant chai bo, soft tender moist rice cake yet good integrity so it doesn't fall apart. Usually quite crowded so be prepared to queue, though uncle and auntie has incredible turnover speed with their nimble hands.","474":"Best Chwee Kueh \"in SG, JB, and some say Batam\" :DBut seriously, Ghim Moh Chwee Kueh is the best I've ever had. Some other chwee kuehs that I had often have this slimmy glue-y texture that I'm not a fan of, but once I tried the ones from Ghim Moh, I sure swore not to eat chwee kueh anywhere else. The texture is firm solid, not slimmy at all. The sauce definitely has the kind of savory taste that I like.I would suggest come here early. I went for breakfast around 9 a.m and the queue was long sia. Because it's just that good :)","475":"I've grown up with this as a kid, so I thought I may be a little biased in my love for the chwee kueh from this stall. Over the years, I got older and more adventurous, yet have not found anywhere selling chwee kueh quite like this. The actual 'kueh' itself is on the right side of being solid - so many others tend to be a little jelly-ish, or a bit too ricey, or just not quite there. The texture and bite of this kueh is the standard for me, and though the difference is not that big a deal in the overall enjoyment, I'd like to take note of this anyway because it reminds me of all the sweat and love that has gone into this hand-made process, where the uncle rises early every morning unfailingly to build that pagoda of chwee kueh you will see behind them in the stall. For a few weeks last year I saw him with a cast around his arm, yet a warm smile on his face. I am happy knowing he is happy making us all so so happy.The magic of this chwee kueh lies in the chye poh. Once you've had chye poh like this and enjoyed it as much as I always enjoy it, it genuinely puzzles me how you could love another sort. This chye poh is the savoury sort, always runny with a little oil, always with a few rough bits to add a little accidental juxtaposition to the texture in your mouth. This is quite unlike the sweet and dry chye poh in a rum-brown colour that you see in so many stalls around - too consistent a texture, and too likely a sweetness. My only qualm might be that there is often not enough chye poh per square centimetre on my chwee kueh, but if you will give the auntie a nice smile and ask politely, she will certainly oblige in giving you a spoonful or two more from her bubbling cauldron.At about 30 cents per piece you're for such a treat - such a treat! Thinking about it now even makes me want to weep, and I have just had 6 pieces myself this morning! It makes me even more delighted to give business to such nice people (not that they need it - there's often a line, but never long enough to turn you off). The auntie is a joy to make conversation with, and even though she's been told how many years into my studies I am on more than one occasion now, she still always forgets and asks again in the most endearing way. I'll miss this for sure if it ever goes away - it is my last bastion of chwee kueh hope in Singapore!","476":"It was very late at night so most restaurants have already closed.The staff are very friendly. \u00a0The food is just ok, especially for Singapore standard. \u00a0I have ordered theLobster noodle and roast duck. \u00a0 The roast duck is pretty good but the lobster noodle is strange. \u00a0If you want to have noodle, this will not be your dish. \u00a0There is a tiny ball of noodle and then half the lobster. \u00a0You can really enjoy either one.","477":"I want to write a scathing post about this place, just based on how unhappy I was at the end of this meal - but I can't bring myself to verbose hostility this morning, and so you have to imagine how bad it was. suffice to say that I was disappointed, not just because this was supposed to be an institution, a stalwart of fine chinese dining in singapore - and what we got, at incredibly high prices and pretty lacking service, was dimsum not even at the standards of the midrange chinese restaurants like yumcha.this may have been one occasion, the first after many years of good food followed by a long gap of nearly five years, but it was enough to discourage from further visits - and almost definitely not for dimsum.the place is packed as it's always been - a phenomenon that was pretty surprising to us at the end of our meal - and its glamorous interior clearly meticulously maintained. I only wish such attention was paid to our food and our meal.it feels rather a waste to tell you what we had - so I shan't. the best dish of the day was perhaps a dish of greens with lily bulbs and tofu skin, and putien's rendition (though slightly different in execution) puts it to shame.none of the dimsum was inedible or terrible, of course, but you don't expect it to be. but I direct you to the paradise group, or yum cha for a better meal - and at much better prices. hotel chinese dining is usually expensive - they come with a pedigree and quality not necessarily attainable at less costly places - but I was pretty annoyed upon paying the bill here.even the sang meen, that cantonese restaurant mainstay of crispy fried noodles served with a dark gravy and seafood, was uninspiring (to say the least). I can't say if it was perfect when it came out of the kitchen, but it spent a careless and incredible amount of time sitting on the waiting table next to us, where we got increasingly concerned - and annoyed - looking at it, as time passed.trying to get attention was pretty futile as our attendant was busy at another table - and when the noodles finally arrived, they had lost their crispness, and taken on an unappealing sponginess from having soaked up all that gravy. the seafood was also of alkali-soaked bouncy consistency, which I attribute more to my local coffee-shop than a restaurant such as this.even the desserts were just so - and my herbal jelly wasn't even fragrantly bitter or firm (it seemed more like a slightly more elastic grass jelly).so, can you tell I was annoyed? bear in mind that servings of dimsum are twice the price they would usually be, tea is served and priced at extravagant per-cup prices (acceptable if they actually had some sort of flavor), and service seems both harried and impossible to get.I hope it a one-off, and I certainly wish you a better meal than mine.","478":"It used to be in the hip side of the city but now this area is just....old. Hopefully after the suntec revamp, it will be more lively.Except for a large table of customers doing wedding banquet tasting, the restaurant is quiet and less than half full.We went for the set menu and it was disappointing. The dishes were different from the usual, but not always in a good way.The only dish we liked out of the 6 dishes is the soup. Presented beautifully and served with bird nest, crab meat, bamboo pith, spinach, this was nice, clean and light.The rest of the dishes were too heavy, nothing memorable. The pork was cooked too dry, the shrimps not tasty enough, the noodles acceptable.For $98+++ per pax, we expected more. This is why we haven't been to this place for a long time and it will probably take a lot more to bring us back.","479":"Visited twice: First time alone, then with a larger group. Both times I experienced excellent food and attentative service. Pricey, though","480":"A quiet, understated restaurant, I've found my new favourite restaurant in town. This is a cosy restaurant in beige, both the furnishing and the waiter\/waitresses. The food, like the service, is excellent, unpretentious and of good value. This is a place perfect if you love a quiet evening of good food, no frills, and want to focus on just your food and company. My first assessment of a restaurant's quality is the bread basket. I believe if a restaurant puts the effort to serve good warm bread that comes free, it can't go very wrong. And we polished off the bread. We weren't even that hungry. The Caesar salad with anchovies was so unassuming, we were a little disappointed at first glance. But once we started, we couldn't stop. The quail was exquisite. Paired with foie gras, and balanced with walnuts and beetroot, it was flavorful and yet not over-powering. Slightly crispy skin and juicy inside. I ate this 2 weeks ago and I still dream of it. I was reluctant to order the chicken at first, because well, it's chicken. Chicken to me is usually a safe choice, can't go very wrong, but not fantastic either. But Gordon Grill's grilled farm chicken as brought chicken to a whole new level. Once again, flavorful, juicy, not oily, and brought out the taste of chicken so well. The chicken melted in my mouth. I thought I died and went to chicken heaven. The grilled pork was pink with perfection. I can't go on further without my mouth watering again. Every dish we had was prepared with thought and care, it was evident. This place is as if it stopped in time where quiet dignity and taking pride in preparing a quality filling meal were cherished. I can't wait to go back there.","481":"Fine dining with great service, lovely facility, and excellent food! \u00a0It's pricey which keeps most of the riffraff out - this means you can get a table at the last minute and enjoy a quiet meal with out jostling for position. \u00a0 The staff is adequately trained and do their best to make it a special eventing. \u00a0The food is a nice fusion of continental and new American and everything taste wonderful. \u00a0They love to provide table service for everything from the salmon carpaccio to the crepes Suzette. \u00a0Wine list isn't too exhaustive but it has what you nee. \u00a0Their steaks are super tinder and done just as you like. \u00a0Flawless evening that will let you pay the big bill without too much regret.","482":"Gordon Grill is a stalwart of the Singapore dining scene ; solid, dependable with comforting with great service and equally great food. We might be occasionally distracted by the new trendy restaurants popping up on the dining scene, but when it comes to deciding on a place where it's cosy, peaceful and reliable, we head straight for Gordon Grill.Food : We always look forward to the crispy snack they provide along with the bread basket. I don't know what it's called but it's uber yummy! I also really like the bread basket. I'm a huge fan of the chilled angel hair pasta with king crab and caviar. One can opt to have it prepared warm as well, but I prefer the chilled version. The lobster bisque is lovely but the highlight of my meal is naturallement, the grilled ribeye. The Snake River Farm wagyu is one of the best ribeye steaks I've had in Singapore (Fat Cow uses the same one we had done charcoal grill style) and they bring it out on the beef trolley to show you the marbling and ask you how much of it you want. Half the fun of having the crepes Suzette is watching it done table side and it's always done really well.Ambience : Cosy and peaceful without loud music or loud conversation. It might be fine dining but it's not overly formal.Service : One of the best. They make it a point to recognise their customers and their preferences. I approve. All service in Singapore should aspire to their standards.I make it a point to try and go at least once a month. You should too!","483":"Gordon grill is a perennial favorite of mine from the old days. They had a complete revamp some years ago with a new chef Gan Swee Lai. A completely new menu. The set for lunch is affordable at $50 and $60 for 4 and 5 courses respectively. The food is very good and portions are very generous. A great meal and worth a visit for all occasions.","484":"Went for set lunch. Gunther's creation for the day was braised beef cheek, paired with pureed potatoes and a sliver of corn, and it was succulent. The cauliflower appetizer with purple mustard and a strip of bacon came together nicely and the flavors complimented each other well - the mild sweetness of the cauliflower with the smoky saltiness of the bacon and bitterness of the mustard. Chocolate ice cream came with creme anglaise and three segments of mandarin. The apple tart seemed German, flat and shaped like a pizza slice with carmelized sugar on top with rum raisin ice cream on the side.Epic.Also, it is a legitimately fancy restaurant. I felt underdressed in jeans.","485":"Fabulous! Gunther's *modern french* dining certainly lives up to its name. I had Gunther's when it first opened a long time ago & i'm glad to be back again tonight. Signature dishes:Angel hair pasta with caviar. Back then this signature dish was all the rage and it still tastes just as good. Light & heavy flavors at the same time to match perfectly with a nice champagne.The foie gras with crushed almonds & hibiscus sauce is a classic & it's return to the menu is a welcome return. Again, light & heavy flavors will match with a nice burgundy or red. Apple tart is not in the photos i uploaded but it is another must try dish. Light flaky crunchy crust matches very well with a light apple filling that won't overwhelm your stomach but is a very welcome end to one's meal & palette. Today's dishes that i had that were memorable... actually they were all great!Onion cheese gratin - a very french influenced dish using onion, the texture & sweetness of the onion is brought out nicely. Langoustine meuniere - full of prawn flavor yet it is very very light. It is sliced very thinly so the gamey taste of raw prawn is not overpowering but its sweetness is brought out, nicely balanced with the cream & caviar.Carabinero gambas prawn - Gunther's is very capable to do a sharing portion for 2 tonight. The 2 spoonfuls of tomato & slightly spicy rice is full of flavor. The prawn is cooked just right with some tasty roe. It's head & brains is cooked to perfection! Pork Belly & Coquille Pasta - Very large portions for sharing. The pork belly is very fulfilling, comforting & satisfying to one's belly. The sauce would match well with a margaux or burgundy! I was feeling very full at this point BUT dessert beckons!For dessert, crepe suzette that was also shared between me & my guest. Gunther's staff will put on a nice show to flambe the crepe's in front of you. The orange sauce is tangy served with an equally tasy ice cream & light crepes that is nicely burnt in a few places. Ambience:Gunther's decor is very simple but its ambience is quite quiet & there are not many tables that adds to the exclusivity of dining here. This is a nice place for a romantic dinner for two.Price: Special's & seasonal items can be quite expensive but given that gunther's is willing to do sharing portions & some dishes are large portions, at least one's belly will not go hungry after the meal. As always, lunch is the best time to go for value for money. Monday's & tuesday are corkage free which adds tremendously to gunther's value. Service:The ratio of servers to each table is approximately 1 to 1-2 tables depending on how booked Gunther's is. Every staff is friendly and willing to explain anything. I recommend Mogish who is a long time staff to take good care you. Overall: Gunther's has been fabulous. My guest was equally delighted. Each dish is a nice gastronomical surprise & a nice refresh of memories from my first dining experience at gunther's. I will return soon! Thanks chef & team!!!","486":"Gunther's is one of the best French restaurants in Singapore. Located in the middle of the shophouses, next to its sister restaurant Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar, another equally well known restaurant. Although the restaurant is quite high end with its equally expensive priced menu, it offers quite a reasonable priced 3 course lunch set at $38++ which is available on weekday.The restaurant is decorated in grey with paintings and dim lights around which gives an elegant setting. Besides the usual menu, the staff also make his offers on what is in season by using a \"daily special cart\". Today there is vegetables from Japan, lamb, wagyu beef, and assorted seafood such king crab, scallop. But the one which holds everyone's attention is the truffle. Even when covers in a glass cover, one can easily smells the earthy pungent smell.Before starting the meal, one is served with hot towel to wipe with. One is served with a pipping warm mini buguette and butter to start the meal. Though the bread looks hard, it is quite crispy and soft to texture.For today's lunch set, there is 3 choices for starter : Farmer's salad, Clear vegetable soup, and Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up egg. Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up eggThe mushroom is quite well flavoured.Next is the main which also comes with 3 choices : Gunther's Creation (seafood pasta), Braised lamb stew, Leffe beer, and Charcoal grilled Wagyu steak (additional S$20++).Cold Angel hair pasta, Oscietra caviar ($60++)However I decide to go with the staff's recommendation to topup $40++ more to change the main course to the restaurant's signature cold pasta dish. It is quite popular which could be found in most tables. Refreshing cold and smells great of truffle which makes one high before eating.The last course is the dessert which also comes with 3 choices : Dessert of the Day (Pineapple Panna Cotta), Cheese Platter (additional S$10++), and Fine apple tart \"\u00e0 la drag\u00e9es\", Havana rum raisin ice cream (additional S$8++).Fine apple tart \"\u00e0 la drag\u00e9es\", Havana rum raisin ice cream ($25++)The apple tart is different from the traditional apple tart. It looks more like a flat pizza. Thin slices of soft caramelised apple on a very thin base. Crunchy and crispy on the outside. The ice cream is rich and creamy. Pairing the cold ice cream and the warm apple tart together is quite a yummy combination.Lastly there is coffee or tea and Petit fours to end the meal with.The coffee is quite rich with a slight bitter and chocolaty taste. I have it with just milk and without sugar. It is just nice to balance with the sweetness from the dessert and petit fours. The petit fours consists of Financier, Canele, Wafer and chocolate. I like the canel, which has a soft and tender custard center with a dark, thick caramelized crust.Overall the food is quite delicious. The place is packed even it is a weekday lunch time. Although the restaurant is busy, its Chef Gunther still make an effort to visit the tables.","487":"Came here three years ago for our anniversary and after a great time here, we recently revisited when my mom was in town again. This time around, there was NO set menu- it's all a la carte, with an exception of $250\/person chef's degustation \"surprise\" menu which we opted for. We weren't disappointed, and their signature caviar pasta still lingers in my palette and memory days after our visit. But I'm not sure if it justified the high price tag ($880 for 3 pax). D and I thought it was a bit pricey for its location and mundane decor (small room with not much decor and no view) and were a bit annoyed that it only offered one set menu or nothing at all and having to go a la carte, as we like the surprises of set courses in fine dining. In comparison, Les Amis offers courses in the range of $150~250 and Jaan $190~$299, which also has sophisticated and lovely decor and an amazing view, respectively, as an added plus.Service was great as always, and every dish was delish (with an exception to truffle that we thought lacked much flavor) so no regrets. But not sure if we'd return again.","488":"No matter where I am, I always have this thing about Lunch Specials! Gunther's Modern French Cuisine is one of the Top 20 restaurants in The Miele Guide with Set Dinner Menu at a price tag of SPD$ 128++. The SPD$38++ lunch set menu for sure sounded like a bargain.Purvis Street where Gunther's located is quite interesting. The business\/restaurants here has this mix of the different cuisine of traditional VS modern, new VS old, local VS international. The co existence of all these restaurants is just how Singapore is as a whole.Gunther's is smallish with just a handful of tables so reservations is highly recommended.There are a couple of choices for Appetizer and Main, and \u00a0I decided on the following:Green Asparagus with Ravioli Foie Gras - I just could not resist when I saw foie gras on the menu. The sauce really complimented the Foie Gras as I cleaned my dish with the warm baguette. The asparagus was cooked perfectly with just the right crunch.Oven roasted cod, b\u00e9arnaise sauce - I found it is just OK, average the most. The Tempura vegetables lack the crispness and off the fryer freshness. Dessert of the Day - Earl Grey Pudding - which is really really good! Light, Smooth and with just the right amount of sweetness!Followed by Petite Four and ended with a cappuccino.The Chef also gave me a taste of their Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar - All I can say is CAVIAR! This suppose to be their signature appetizer and I have to say it is Excellent!! Refreshing and light and \u00a0Truffle Oil!! CAVIAR!!Services is attentive and professional. Great Food! Great Value! Lunch Specials ROCKS!","489":"I have heard rave reviews about Gunther's for a very long time. The name just keep on coming across my ears for years; but for some reason, I just never ended up there. We're not completely sure what made us go there, but we decided to go there to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.I had the truffle soup for my starter and it was up to standard. It was creatively served with pumpkin veloute; I think they match well. Le wife had \"Floating island of champignons de Paris\" which is basically consomme, with thinly sliced mushrooms. It was disappointing tbh. The dish was completely lacking and just too plain.The second course was the star of the night. I had the scampi carpaccio, cream, caviar and it just blew my mind. I'm a fan of a simple-dish-done-well and this dish was executed to perfection. The ingredients were fresh and the cream compliments the caviar perfectly without overpowering it. Le wife had what I think was their signature dish, the cold angel hair with caviar. It's not a unique dish, but again, the execution was spot on.The third dish was decent. I'm a big fan of prawn so I decided to go for the carabinero gambas, which is basically those red prawns from the Mediterranean Sea. It was not the best one that I've ever had, but it was still ok. It was slightly overcooked for me, and there was some tomato risotto that just felt out of place. Le wife had bamboo clam with black truffle.The main course was another dish that I love. We shared the roasted rack of pata negra pig. At first bites, I thought it was just a mediocre pork chop. But the after taste of the pork was just superb, I feel like this is a very deep and mature dish that you just can't stop eating. Heck, I even took 1\/2 of my wife's pork!The dessert was also great. We shared the apple tart a la dragees. It's a very thin and crispy apple pie. It was a little bit too sweet to my taste, but it didn't stop me from finishing them.Overall, I'd definitely be back to Gunther's. I heard they have a great lunch deal but even without it, a future visit to Gunther's is imminent.","490":"I had friends and business associates visiting from Beijing and London. I planned to host them for dinner. \u00a0There would be at least 8 and possibly 10 of us.Three of the upmarket restaurants that I contacted insisted that a party of 8 or more must all order an agreed set dinner! \u00a0I was astounded to hear that a high dollar restaurant could not be bothered to take individual orders from my guests.One restaurant did agree to take my request for individualized service to their general manager for consideration but I told them not to bother. If a decision to give a customer and each of his guests what they wanted to eat required top manager approval then I was obviously talking to the wrong restaurant.I took a chance and hosted the dinner at Gunther's. We spent about 3 hours and about S$2,500 in Gunther's. \u00a0Not only did I consider the money well spent, I considered it a bargain.Everyone got exactly what they wanted and was extremely pleased with the quality of the food, the ambience and the attentive service.You can't go wrong with Gunther's. There are not enough upmarket restaurants in Singapore where you can get a fantastic meal served by friendly staff who are happy to meet your requests rather than insisting that you confine your expectations to the limits of their policies.Fortunately for the more demanding Singaporeans, there are still restaurants like Gunther's.All five stars were fully earned.","491":"I decided to have lunch at Gunther's after reading some of the outstanding reviews not only on this site, but on Tripadvisor as well. Overall, I was thought the food and experience was very mediocre. They start by bringing around a cart of some of the ingredients they have in house, truffles, tiger prawns, wagyu, etc...a bit of an unnecessary show if you ask me. I sampled the chilli prawn as a starter, it was presented nicely but lacked flavor...especially considering some of the flavorful cooking methods Singaporeans use for tiger prawns!My main entree was the special wagyu. The wagyu was good quality, a little fatty for my liking but still pretty good. HOWEVER, the \"sides\" were pathetic- a friend onion, and some sort of \"crispy chip\"...I'd rather have no side then to have them put something so depressing on my plate.The atmosphere is a bit dark and depressing, but Gunther was in the kitchen himself \u00a0on a Tuesday afternoon which at least showed the restaurant is making an effor","492":"After all these years, still my number one go to place for fine dining in Singapore. Best value for money on the set lunches and ideal for long celebration dinners, let Belgian chef Gunther amaze you with a surprise chef's degustation menu you won't be disappointed.","493":"Gunther's is a French restaurant that cannot be missed. The elegant ambience of the restaurant and exemplary service makes you feel pampered, while the good fare feels like a treat. The restaurant is located at the central area of City Hall and Bugis, which is accessible and convenient. This restaurant has merited positive reviews for its angel hair pasta, so I had to try one of those. I ordered the Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar and was not disappointed. The pasta was cooked to al dente and seasoned generously with truffle oil, and finally topped with Oscietra Caviar. The amazing flavor of the seasoning coupled with the bounciness of the pasta made it a satisfying dish. For dessert, the Canele from the Petit four was outstanding. It is a bite-sized snack in perfect proportions, and is crispy on the outside and chewy inside; a good finale to the meal.","494":"Easily my favoritest high-end restaurant in Singapore! Suggestion: order the fresh seafood.. the dead-eyed fish may seem slightly scary, but I promise that you will not regret splurging on this :)","495":"Divine food. \u00a0From start to finish, each dish brings its best flavor out of the ingredients and very well thought through taste. \u00a0Apple tarte is a must - make sure you share, the portion was huge. \u00a0Great for date night, special occasion and corporate dinners.","496":"I enjoyed the set lunch at Gunther's. The food was good and the service, professional. Nothing to complain about! I really would like to try the Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar next.","497":"I should periodically revisit this review. Today's duck rice set was very good, $3.50, better value for money than getting the $15+ duck. Still a queue, but it moves fast. The duck is still tender, its skin fat still meltingly flavourful.","498":"During my visit to Tekka Market, I noticed a long line for Heng Gi, so I jumped in as well. Basically, all they serve is duck and rice, so guess what? I got duck and rice. For 3.50 SGD, you get a plate of duck, rice with sauce, and a bowl of duck soup. The duck was very tender, and the soup had good flavor as well. For the price, it is hard to beat.","499":"Sorry not sure what the fuss about this stall. \u00a0Meat is mostly dry but strangely they got followers. \u00a0Ordered a plate with meat, egg, tofu and liver. \u00a0Que was mostly quick to clear. \u00a0Total cost with 3 rice came to 16.50. \u00a0Cheap and can't complaint but certainly not a cut above the rest more like the norm. \u00a0Think this lose out to the once almighty Buana Vista duck rice which is now passed to the brother in law and is located at at odd place and does not taste as good. \u00a0Sadly all these skills will be gone.","500":"Just writing this review make me drool - that's how good the duck at Heng Gi is. My dad used to do takeaways when the stall was still at Hill Street Hawker Centre so this is pretty much my benchmark of how duck should be.The dark sauce in which the duck is simmered in is always slightly on the saltier side but I am not one to complain about that. What I like best about Heng Gi is that the meat is always tender and tasty - I usually avoid having duck because most stalls aren't good at getting this right. Here, the duck is served up with soft beancurd and braised eggs, topped with sprigs of coriander and a bowl of steaming white rice - probably in the running for the last meal I would want to have. Oh! Not to forget the chilli because I think that is what seals the deal for this stall. Smashed chilli with garlic mixed with vinegar acts as the perfect dip for the fragrant salty duck meat. Sells out in a blink of an eye so make sure you get there before 2pm!","501":"This is one of the few places which I will save my calories for. The plate of CKT is moist & the cockles (very slightly cooked) is super. One bite, you can taste the wok-hei, the crunchiness (the bean sprouts, garlic & tiny bits or pork lard), and the moistness the noodles & cockles. Sweet heaven! I always need to restraint myself in this Bedok South Market. Go on vegetarian diet for a month, then allocate calories to Hill Street Fried Kway Teow.I rarely queue for food. No matter how good it is. If the waiting is too long, I'd just eat something else.Still, this is one of the few CKT that is worth the calories & cholesterol.","502":"I've had this char kuay teow for more than a decade now because I do live just one block away. It is good and above average for char kuay teows. However, the quality has dropped since the old old uncle has retired, and his son (?) took over. The noodles are underfried, and are a little soggier than before. The flavor is still there, but because it is wetter, it is not as awesome as the old uncle's frying. I ate this when it was only $2. Now it's $3.50 or $4 for a plate...","503":"Still one of the best Fried Kway Teow in Singapore. Best served when you fried extra egg on it","504":"Some like it dryer, some like it a little bit more wet; all a personal preference. I like mine a little more wet with big juicy blood cockles (aka seahum).I had this when they were still really at Hill Street. I remember really enjoying it there. After years of mostly trying to avoid this dish for health issues, i very occasionally dig in to this once or twice year only.The queue here is always long and I bought the biggest baddest plate they got which was the $4 portion with an added $1 for seahum totalling to $5. Still tasty, has the wokhei taste people look for in this dish, but not so wet with eggy goodness as it was before. The seahum that day was lacklustre to say the least. Small and shrivelled.Although the queues here still snake till the moment they off their lights... I feel it has turned average. Still better than many of the new unknowns, but definitely no where as good as they were before.3.2 Stars","505":"Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our \"go to\" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although the Char Kway Teow was good here, I don't think the massive line represents how good it was in regards to others we went to and isn't always a measure of quality.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the \"Wok Hei\" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.Although the flavours balanced very well, the Wok Hei wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and this lacked that substance and pow that you get when the Wok Hei is infused to perfection. Given Hill Streets Kway Teow's reputation and a glimpse of how good it could be from my taste, I'll be back again to confirm whether it was an \"off\" day or not but with a 20 minute line, if it's not stellar next time, I won't be back.Cheers!Dave.","506":"Sorry guys this stall is one of my favorite stall to spend my cholesterol credits. \u00a0Just went there yesterday ordered the big plate at 4 bucks and endured the wait for 20 minutes. \u00a0The Q forms an L shape to the stall. \u00a0If you lines up starting at the pillar on your right that be 40 minutes minimum. \u00a0So i was lucky to just before the L. \u00a0Noticing this stall got an average of 3.5 is pretty unfair so thought do a 5 to get the scores up. \u00a0If it is that bad why bother 40 minutes for a simple dish as this and brings you nothing but carbohydrate and cholesterol etc. \u00a0so thete we go get your fix here buy be zen and wait with a smile.","507":"The line can be so exasperating that you feel that you need to buy more than one plate.And you totally should. Worry about the calories tomorrow.","508":"Award winning fried kway teow in bedok area. The store is rated by makansutra as die die must try. Though the amount of oil they used can be quite generous, the food is definitely worthy of the long queue that is always there!","509":"I don't eat Fried Kuay Teow often, because it is not the best for diets but when I do, I often go only for the best. So you can imagine, I was really excited when I got to try the Hill Street Char Kway Teow. It's pretty flavourful. The kway teow was done well and blended well in the soy sauce with the generous serving of ingredients - beansprouts, chinese sausage, clams, chives, etc.It was a little underwhelming though, because I've heard SO MUCH about it. But it is still in all a decent plate of CKT. My final verdict: I won't travel for it, but if I happen to be in the area, I'll be happy to tuck into a plate of this local classic. You should decide for yourself too!","510":"Not the most healthy of dishes, but judging by the length of the queues, most people seem willing to take this risk. The standard of the Fried Kway Teow remains the same, not suffering any dip in form and has been consistently ranked among the best, if not the best in Singapore. The long queues are quite annoying as waiting times can sometime be up to 30mins or more for just one plate of fried kway teow. The food centre itself is fairly huge, with ample seating, but because it shares the space with a wet market, it might not be the most conducive place to have it at.","511":"Famous Michelin-star bak chor mee stall in SG. The noodle here is very flavorful - strong flavors across sweet\/salty\/sour\/spicy which makes the bak chor mee standout. They also give you a lot of sides to accompany the noodle - sliced pork, minced pork, wonton, meatballs, liver, noodle crisps - everything taste excellent and a good balance to the noodle. Portion is big which probably explains the above average price. Would go back again if in the area. However, while this is a very good bak chor mee, it's probably not good enough to warrant 1 hour+ wait during peak hours","512":"Michelin 1-Star (2016) coffee shop stall with 1-2 hr long queue. Arrived 11.20am, with over 1 hr wait in line, in hot humidity. Each bowl is freshly individually prepared, average 2-5 min per customer depending on # bowls order at $6, $8, $10. Recommend $6 bowl, better value. Tasty noodles in chili and vinegar sauce, with pork balls, mince pork, liver, wanton. Good noodles, but not worth 1 hr wait and price. Of Michelin cuisines tasted in France, Germany, Italy, USA, am not sure how this one-star was awarded. At best, only bib gourmand, in my view. Not worth long wait, come off peak hours if curious to try. Many other good bak chor noodles elsewhere with better queues and price.","513":"You can write 10-15 Yelp reviews while on queue!I personally didn't mind the wait and thoroughly enjoyed the noodles after ~1.5hr of waiting. Maybe I was just hungry? I wish I had ordered a larger bowl after waiting for that long.I'm not sure if I'd be back but it's definitely a place to try out at least once because if its Michelin status.","514":"Noodle in general is good. Abit salty for me, but still ok lar... however, queues up for 1.5+ for a bowl of pork noodle, maybe not as worth though. U decide...","515":"Pretty solid place with some awesome flavours. I had the dry noodles and it was really awesome to get so many different pork meat varities in different forms. The sauce is a bit spicy and the soup delicious. Not something I would wait for but worth a one time visit.","516":"2017 Michelin stars: 1The dish is delicious. Let's get that right out of the way. So much so, that I've spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. Obviously my homemade version isn't as good, but with some tweaks I think it could be a passable substitute. Here is where the wheels fall off the wagon. It's cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it's received. On our first attempt, we waited for about 1.25 hours and only moved 4 tiles (we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go) which was not much. We gave up.We returned the next morning 30 minutes before opening and received number `11`. If you guys are missing a number `11`, I might know why. It was another hour wait before we got our food -- this time we were determined; which was delicious as I've mentioned. The whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of Singaporean weather was just lost on me. Yes the food was delicious. Yes it was cheap. But for a Michelin star you have to do something above and beyond. I feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over Singapore, you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha.. It's the challenge that Yelp and Michelin diners face -- seek these places out! Find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent. Blaze the trail for others to follow. Don't just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective. You might find something you really like... A diamond in the rough.","517":"Since this was listed on the Michellin Guide, I have to give it a try. I planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported. Arrived at 5pm and there was a queue but tolerable. Waited 30 minutes for my food. A good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you. Multiply by 2 as each is likely ordering for 2 people. Then multiply by 2 again as it takes 2 mins to prepare a bowl of noodles. So # of people in front of you * 4 = average wait time. Is it worth waiting more than 30 mins? I don't think so. The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good. There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything. A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom. Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs. My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time.","518":"This place gets 4 stars for the 2 hour wait... \u00a0It just might not be worth it. \u00a0I know I wouldn't line up again. The only incredible part of this is how slow the line moves. \u00a0The food is pretty good, and would be on my 5 star list (also has a michelin star) if there wasn't a line. \u00a0The liver is extremely well done, and tender. \u00a0The noodles are pretty good, but does this make it significantly better than other bak chor mee places? Nah. It's the best you'll get but not worth the wait if you can go elsewhere. \u00a0I'd try it once, if there's almost no line, and that's it. People line up before they open so maybe consider getting there very early?","519":"One word. AMAZING. We went on a Tuesday morning, thinking it wouldn't be packed. But when we got to the store at around 10:30, there was already roughly 20 people in line. After roughly 2 hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles, we finally got our orders in.And let me say this. The wait was totally worth it. The noodles were hand pulled, very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base. There was a wide selection of minced pork, liver, sliced pork, wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl. Plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours. The combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite. Crunchy, savoury, sour and spicy. Definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good, especially with the pricing being $8 for medium.","520":"One of the two hawker food stalls awarded a Michelin star! The line can be long, and it does take a while to get your food. But just know that it's because it's a popular spot. Also, they make the noodles one bowl at a time.Two noodles options: with soup or dry. Both noodles have a mix of pork meat and organs and wontons. We got one of each, and I would say the dry one, bak chor mee, is the more flavorful one. A mix of chili, soy sauce, vinegar on the bottom; freshly cooked noodles on top; then the meats and wontons.Four sizes available. $5, $6 (regular), $8, $10.","521":"The queue was pretty short when I dropped by. It was just a 15 minutes wait. Maybe because the regulars knew that the staffs were going for 15-minutes lunch break soon at 2.30pm. I was lucky to be the second last order to be made before the break.Orders that cannot be completed by 2.30pm would be given a queue number.The serving looked a tab small for S$10 and served with a bowl of seaweed soup. I was not full after finishing it and seem to be lacking of the wow factor. The sauce was a tab bland although not too vinegary. Like that the pig's liver was cooked just right - tender. There's lots of pieces of crispy flat fish in it.","522":"I got to Tai Hwa 30 minutes after opening and waited in line 1 hour 15 minutes. I appreciated that each batch of meat was cooked to order for just the right amount of time, ensuring tender pork and liver. The noodles were springy and the sauce punchy and well balanced. While I definitely enjoyed my noodles, it was not amongst my favorites in Singapore. If I lived in the neighborhood I would visit again. Otherwise I am sure places with equally delicious noodles and a shorter wait exist. Just have to be in the know I guess!","523":"Overrated.Is it significantly better than your average bak chor mee? Yes.Is a tiny handful of noodles (in a deceptively large bowl) good enough to be worth $6 and 0.5-2 hours of your time? No.Say an hour of your time is worth only $8. Would you pay $10-22 for this bowl of noodles (if it meant no queueing up)? If not, then what are you doing here?","524":"Now that it has received a Michelin star, there are more tourists joining the queue for some bak chor mee. We went at 5pm on a Friday and it still took about 45 minutes to wait in line for the food. There were about 14 people ahead of me. But we saw there were only 2 people in line at 6pm. Hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest. The queue system is neater now. Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait. The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6. It was soft but a bit on the salty side. I still gave it a 3 stars because of the queue system. Not everyone can stand for that long. I rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait.","525":"Whilst making my research on a trip to Singapore, this food stall caught my eye being rated 1 Star in Michelin Guide 2017 for Singapore, also being ranked No. 1 in the World Street Food Masters List 2017. I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup\/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like \"I'll come back one day\". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!","526":"Well, it's good, but to come specially for this place - there are so many good eating places in Singapore- so again - I enjoyed my dish - but unless you really coming around 17:00 - when the q is quit short - I wouldn't bother","527":"1 hour wait for this one Michelin star bak chor mee noodles! Pretty good time if you ask me.This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing! The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good! Comes with a cup of liver\/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters. Would defos come back if I were in Singapore again!","528":"China style noodles! Definitely order a large bowl. You have to wait a long time so might as well eat more. :)","529":"The Michelin Star wasn't awarded for the late afternoon one hour wait or shabby looking exterior. Endure the wait, though, and you'll get an incredible bowl of Pork noodles. I asked for $10, dry - and it was phenomenal. The noodles were perfectly cooked, supplemented by a refreshing soup. If you can endure the wait - bring water - you'll be rewarded.","530":"This changes your expectations of a Michelin star meal. Firstly you have to be ok waiting for 45 minutes in line. The noodles were good made of all different forms of pork but my favorites was still the basic meatballs. If you look at this as a bowl of noodles in isolation it was ok, what made it special was the effort the noodles seemed to take juxtaposed with the price.","531":"Meh, I thought the noodle was very mediocre and missed any flavor. Not worth it for me.","532":"Mee Is WorthyThe results are in and all the culinary buzz in Singapore has been filled with nothing but the official Singapore Michelin Guide, about who's worthy and who's not. I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins.","533":"So this place received a gazillion accolades Michelin star being one among them. Expect lineups at 4PM as well, you've 3 dishes to choose from, but overall didn't care too much for mine, just walked away from mine after eating 2\/3rds of it. But at these provrsx(10$ and under) worth the try if line up isn't too long.","534":"Don't need much review. This place has enough five stars. The first Michelle star pork noodle in the world. So proud that our singapore hawker food made it to the Michelle star. Remains as my top choice if I have the time to queue!","535":"I'm not sure what the hype is, but it's basically a pork noodle bowl (Bak Chor Mee) with minced pork, sliced pork, liver, meatballs, wontons, and salted fish. \u00a0It was pretty good tasting but I felt it had way too much going on in it. \u00a0Maybe I prefer the simpler dishes I had grown accustomed to during my stay here, but I would say it's not worth going out of your way for. \u00a0If you absolutely must go, it's probably best to go during the daytime here.","536":"I am definitely a fan of the food, but not the line for it. Unfortunately, it has gotten even more popular with the Michelin Star, hence it was one hour and forty minutes line up time for my friends. Perhaps, they can open up a second store somewhere else as I seriously want to go back and have this soon!! X.X","537":"Had a similar Pork noodle 20 years ago when I was in singapore and thought wanna try one this time during my formula one visit. Friend recommended to me this Michelin one star rated noodle shop. Expected to wait for an hour but guess what, we have waited for 2 full hours for this noodles! The noodle itself was very good but definitely I will never wait this long again for this!!!","538":"Lured by a shining Michelin star, we queued up behind 25 minutes of other patrons.In short, this joint has a lot of hype, it admirably tries to fulfill that hype, but at the end of the day, it's a mom and pop spot serving authentic, cultural noodle dishes on a thin margin. In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost. \u00a0The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor. \u00a0The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers. Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish. \u00a0After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know. \u00a0In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold.","539":"I think most Westerners need to be careful with this Michelin Star as it isn't for many taste palates. It is definitely worth a try but I spoke to many foreigners who didn't like the dish. I arrived at 2:30 on a weekday and there was practically no line\/queue. I ordered the $6 bowl and watched the magic happen with the food.I agree, the noodles are extra springy with a beautiful texture. Otherwise, even for me, the liver was a bit strong for my taste. I still finished my portion fairly quickly and was still hungry so got myself another order. :)If you can do so, come between the peak hours and just try it out!","540":"My friends and I pretty much ordered their entire menu. \u00a0The wet style noodles were simple, flavorful pork base broth look funn. \u00a0 This same soup was used in the seaweed soup and the meatball soup. \u00a0The dry style noodles had some spicy, vinegar mixture with yellow flat noodles. \u00a0The dry style mixture wasn't overpowering amd it was well controlled. Out of all the dishes my favorite was the meatballs, because the juice of the meat seemingly burst as you bite into it, the pork flavors fills your palates as it travels. \u00a0The only thing is the line is terrible, I personally wouldn't stand in line again.","541":"As I was on a Michelin food hunt that day, after eating the soy sauce chicken in Chinatown, I immediately headed over to this noodle place for lunch. Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special. If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass.","542":"First saw pics of the noodles from Tai Hwa on Instagram and knew this would be one of my first stops during our Singapore trip. \u00a0After reading a few reviews, I knew to avoid this place during peak times so we ended up coming for a late lunch on a Monday. \u00a0For some reason the taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong location (not far but ended up walking a few blocks). \u00a0I was glad to have google maps open so that we could find this place. \u00a0We arrived to find a short line and waited about 5 mins before placing our order. \u00a0For those that don't speak Mandarin, I'm not sure how successful you'll be ordering food here as the guy who took our order did not speak Cantonese and spoke very very little English. \u00a0It took a total of 15 minutes before we sat down to eat. \u00a0I ended up with a $5 bak chor mee bowl of noodles and it definitely lived up to the hype! \u00a0I would definitely wait an hour for a bowl of their dry bak chor mee noodles in a heartbeat! \u00a0A definite must try when coming to Singapore!!!!","543":"Review for Nov2016 - Queue is long (about 1hr) during the lunch hour, but would definitely come here. Came with a friend and had both variants of the noodles and it was definitely worth the wait and would come back again","544":"Woot! Michelin Star food for $6!Here's a tip, if you go at 8am, you can get a number and have your spot saved in line. Then come back at 9:30 (when they open) and wait for your number to be called.I had number 23 and my number wasn't called till almost 11. (the stand also primarily speak in Chinese ).I got the Bak Chor Mee and the soup base is really the most awesome part of the dish. The dish is spicy\/tangy so definitely more of an acquired taste for some people.","545":"dear sweet fanciful moses this was the best bowl of noodles I've ever had. \u00a0I normally like the toppings better than noodles in noodle dishes because I'm not a huge carbs person, but I ate an entire large bowl of these. \u00a0They are perfectly fresh al dente goodness with theeee best flavor to them. \u00a0I also usually shy away from liver but this tasted.. less... livery? lol. \u00a0Sorry for the lame description. \u00a0Much foodie. \u00a0The dried fish bits were my favorite! \u00a0Sounds gross but yum I could've eaten a bag of those like chips on their own.I got in line at 10:50 am on a Sunday and still waited 45 minutes in a line of mayyyybe 20 people. \u00a0They really take their time and make each bowl perfectly. \u00a0I would honestly queue up for that long again. \u00a0It was completely worth it. \u00a0I'm sure it's only going to get busier as they've been awarded a Michelin star so go early to avoid sweating your ass off in a line all day.Go for the large $10 bowl. \u00a0I don't have a huge appetite and I still finished the large bowl fine. \u00a0If you're gonna queue for that long, go big or go home :) Went great with a $1.50 iced lemon tea from the stall right next to it!","546":"not quite sure that this hawker stand lived up to the 1-michelin star hype in my book...me and justin b. showed up on a tuesday afternoon around 2pm hoping to catch the in between lunch\/dinner lull, but i guess everyone else had the same idea b\/c the line was at least 30-40 people deep when we showed up. the line moves so slow and its kind of a bummer there's no limit to the amount of food that 1 person can order so you may see a single person ahead of you that buys like 6 bowls of food and with the hot\/humid singapore weather and only a few fans in the area to cool you down...waiting in line is not a fun experience haha. the only redeeming thing is that there is a drink stand next door where you can get a cold soda to help cool down or order food from the other stalls to satisfy your hunger pains haha...we ended up waiting 2 hours for our bowl of food :( upon first bite of the bak chor mee, i wasnt immediately wow-ed. the whole sweet\/sour\/tangy flavor combination isnt my favorite...but as i continued to eat, my bowl of noodles, pork, dumplings, and fish balls grew on me and i liked the flavors more and more with each bite. i think we ordered the $8 SGD bowl which is about $5ish USD and for that price point, its still a great deal and value. i had never had bak chor mee before this experience and i'm glad i got to experience this dish while in singapore...but i cannot justify this 2-hour wait.","547":"We had the Bak Chor Mee. Nice.","548":"I'm of Chiu chow descent so trust me when I tell you I love love love bak chor mee. We came here right before it opened to get a number tag for the cue. We made it about 10 mins before they opened and got #9. The whole wait time was about 20-30 mins. Definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders. Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line. It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it. \u00a0You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though. The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me. There isn't a lot of meat but most dishes don't come with a lot of meat in south east Asia. We also got the meatball soup! Yummy! I would definitely come back as long as I could avoid the lines. Definitely go a little earlier, even if it's like 2 minutes. The line gets long, fast!","549":"As a tourist from the US who generally likes Asian noodle dishes I was intrigued by the favorable reviews of this eatery. And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1\/4 mile NE of Raffles) that, in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.It was fortunate that I had written down \"bak chor mee\" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile.","550":"singapore is never short of cheap and good food. but when it comes to having awesome nosh, singaporeans will need to scour every single nook and crany for the best. When you feel like chowing down on a good bowl of pork noodle (Bak Chor Mee as we would call it), please come here. The queue during lunch might be a little daunting, so try to come down during off peak hours but even during off peak, one can expect to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes to see the front of the queue. So don't come famished but almost hungry. :)Remember the soup nazi from Seinfeld? Well, we do have an experience with the whole ordering process. You will have to order in a particular sequence - price of the bowl you want, type of noodle, dry or soup and then all the misc special request (less spicy, more vinegar, no liver etc). If in a group, please remember to order per bowl. so don't go like \"2 bowls of $5 mee pok, no chill\" - you will be left #ignored. When your bowl is presented to you, you will be glad you actually waited. the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee. you have the minced pork, the liver slices, the singluar meatball, that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop. Mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite. The accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like! (till the next time I go back).So to have some authentic pork noodle, come down here and get an awesome bowl or two! Please invite me along the next time anyone is going down and I will be glad to join you in enjoying an awesome bowl of bak chor mee!","551":"Its a one michelin star place.. went there with high expectations. The line wasn't too bad as compared to the previous two famous carts I'd been to. I just didn't like the noodles, the texture and taste is something I just didn't enjoy. That being said, you should still give it a try, I'm pretty sure most people standing in line really enjoyed it.","552":"Queued for approximately an hour and a half a week after the Michelin announcement.I came with a huge expectation and, to be perfectly honest, was left pretty disappointed by the dish. Although the noodle base was undoubtedly unique, I found the noodle and other ingredients very normal and forgettable. Then again, I do admit that I have never been a fan of Bak Chor Mee.This stall (barely) deserves its one star due to its incredible noodle base; however, I will probably not come back anytime soon.","553":"Favorite fan of Bak Chor Mee forever. Heard about this no. 1 BC mee and it's snaking queue. Hence tried it today. Ordered a $10 & $6, after queueing for 45mins. Extremely disappointed. Noodles is thick and not so springy. \u00a0Ingredients are fresh. Base sauce is so so. Overall not really worth the price and time. Doubtful will come and queue again.Advice to owner is that he should concentrate on cooking instead of also being the cashier. Hence undercooked noodles.","554":"Like others before me have said, if you can get past waiting in line for 30 mins on average (and upwards of 1hr during peak hours and days), then you're in for a real treat. I ordered the much talked about pork noodles with the broth on the side, and it was absolutely delicious. While I have had noodles of this style elsewhere, I have never tried it with the unique vinegar sauce mixture that the chef so craftily pours over the fresh noodles which are made on site.All in all, this is a great example of a local gem!","555":"It must be a good day for me as I didn't have to Q for a long time. \u00a0I think the noodle used to be better, now, it's simply too overrated. \u00a0I have tasted better and hope Tai Hwa will return to the standard it used to have when it was at Hill Street.","556":"Tiny hawker stand with only three items on their menu. Heard the line can get crazy. We went around 3 hoping no one would be there but still had to wait about 10-15 mins. Not bad. They have a dry noodle, a soup noodle and a beef ball soup. My husband got the dry noodle and I got the soup noodle. It is interesting how you pick a size by $ amount and not small medium or large. Every stands in line on the left where you pick up food and the guy will call you up to the right side to place your order. My husband loved his dry noodle. My soup noodle was just so so. Dry noodle definitely tasted a lot better. I would never wait an hour for the soup noodle.","557":"When my wife asked me why I did not heed the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate recommendation to \"limit refined grains\", I answered, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every bowl of bak chor mee that comes from the coffee shop on Crawford Lane.'\"I had to put it down in writing on Yelp before I could order my extra large bowl of bak chor mee.","558":"Definitely one of the best Mee Pok I have tasted in Singapore.Nice chewy al dented style of egg noodles mixed in with pork lard, soy sauce and chilli.Definitely worth a bite if you have the time to stand in line for at least 30 minutes","559":"If you like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is the place for you. If you don't like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is still the place for you. Whenever I'm away from Singapore, I have dreams about this bowl of goodness. Haters can nitpick all they want, but IMMA LET YOU FINISH, BUT THIS IS THE BEST BAK CHOR MEE OF ALL TIME.","560":"AMAZING.i was taken here not knowing what bak chor mee even was, nor what awaited me. my delicate californian constitution could not handle the heat and 1 hour 10 min wait in line to get my food, but damn, was all that worth it! (it helped that i waited in line with 2 lovely ladies).this bak chor mee was delicious. chilli, vinegar, and perfectly QQ noodles!didn't really care about the wonton, but the pork and liver were delicious (although i wish there were more).i can't really compare to other bak chor mee, since i'm a novice, but i know good food, and this was good food.","561":"I've not had vinegary mee pok before. There, I said it. What's with the judgey looks, people? Geez!So I embarked upon a mee pok trail, and this was one of those die die must tries. We got there slightly before 11am, and a wild queue of 18-20 people greets us. Curses! Still, we duly wait, as dining companion really likes her mee pok. Fast forward about 40mins later, it's finally our turn and we both end up with mee kia as it turns out, while she likes mee pok, the mee pok noodles here are too doughy for her liking. And it's true, even the mee kia seems pudgier than those elsewhere, and these upsized strands have a less QQ bite than I'd prefer. Sad.Vinegar hit is ok, neither too subtle nor overpowering. The chilli leans towards the mild side, and the ingredients are mostly meaty stuff- one wanton, one meat ball, some minced pork, pork slices and liver. A bit measly, really. You know the episode where Karl Pilkington goes to China, and when he treks the wall and goes 'it's not a Great wall. It's an alright wall. It's the Alright Wall of China.'? Yup, for me, it's just an alright bowl of noodles. Plus the ridiculous wait.. I think not.","562":"According to Teochew Ah Pa, the price has gone up with inflation. Now the smallest bowl is $5 and we ordered 3 bowls of dry BCM, 2 Mee Kia and 1 Mee Pok. The queue is of course, very long as always.Alas, the much-awaited BCM came up and yes, it was the same old taste that we've had previously. It does not hold back on vinegar and seasonings, and thus give a satisfying kick which lures you back for more.No pork lard but crispy pieces of flatfish still works for us. My family love our BCM the spicy way but their plain version is equally competent. You can self service to more vinegar if you like.That said, we noted a problem this time round. Too much sodium in the wanton dumplings and also noodles. I did not remember the food being so heavily seasoned the last time (or my memory must be failing......) But it could also be this distinctive taste or that keeps the business going so well after many years.Indeed, we got thirsty hours after the meal. But well, once-in-a-blue-moon bowl of comforting and satisfying Bak Chor Mee won't hurt too much.","563":"A lot of newspapers, articles, etc about this place. One ridiculous article i found was posted right in front of the cashier, which says about two men fighting due to the queuing and police came to reconcile. waited for 20 mins, they normally had one lady take your order first and then the old man cooking. he used many bowls by putting some little meat, soup in every bowl and then dump to another place. he never ended up using that same bowl for serving. i really had no idea what he was doing. all the meat like pork and pork liver were raw. he basically just put the soup in it so it cooked by itself. the noodles are quite normal, the soup bowl on the side was very fatty and oily, the flavor is just vinegar plus spicy sauce. i don't see why it is so famous or special.","564":"Each time I think of Bak Chor Mee, I dutifully make my way down to this stall to get my fix.Springy noodles cooked al dente style (chinese version) with lots of tasty tiiny meat chunks, meat balls, salted fish tossed in a delicious blend of vinegar, chilli, soya sauce and oil!There's liver too but I always opt out of that.Best ever - not two thumbs up but 10 fingers up!","565":"A really unassuming establishment until you see how popular it is by the line that forms. \u00a0Tai Hwa isn't a popular hawker center like Newton's or Maxwell's but it is really a gem! When I first got my bowl, I was thinking \"this is it for $6?\" but it really is a small bowl of quality goodness. \u00a0Every single item is thoughtfully crafted and placed as an integral part of a whole. \u00a0Their preparation is arguably inefficient; however, you won't argue any longer once you eat it! \u00a0Always get the pork noodles, dry. \u00a0It sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and the noodles are FRESH. \u00a0As in, they are handmade (at least that's what it seems) and cooked upon order. \u00a0Topping the noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, dry fried fish, etc. \u00a0You get a bowl of soup on the side as well.I saw some other people with bigger portions so you can probably get there for extra $$ if you're feeling hungrier or want more goodness.","566":"I am not a fan of Bak Chor Mee and I find the Bak Chor Mee here average. But people who love it are queuing an average of 20-30 minutes for the food. From own experience of queuing, I deduced that the wait is long and the queue is slow because the person preparing the the food seem slow..Further observing the preparation prove I am right but that is because they treat their food seriously. Even though I am not their fan, I have friends around me who are and they make it a point to go all the way to Larvender MRT to have it. Those who are interested can try for themselves and they are open most of the days from 9.30am to 9pm except 1st and 3rd Monday of each month.","567":"The best minced pork noodle in Singapore. \u00a0The noodle is cooked just al dente ..... most other hawkers in Singapore tend to over-cook their noodles but not this chap. \u00a0The morsels of meat are also cooked just right, tender, juicy and succulent. \u00a0This just shows to me that a lot of attention to detail has gone into cooking that bowl of noodle.Expensive for a bowl of hawker noodle but well worth the price. \u00a0The only pet peeve I have for this place is the long wait. \u00a0Budget for at least an hour of queuing. \u00a0Is it worth the wait ..... hmm, the jury is still out as I really dislike having to stand in line and wait for my food. \u00a0But, if you want to try the best \"bak chor mee\" in Singapore, this is the place!","568":"Nothing else is comparable to the noodles here. This is evidenced by the long lines every day, and I do mean every day! We were there at 10.30am on a wednesday and there is a line of 10 persons! Once we joined the line, 5 more were behind us immediately!Tip: morning is cooked by the boss himself, lunch hour his \"sous-chef\", dinner another worker. I only go when it is either the boss himself or the sous-chef. It is all in the number of nano-seconds the noodle is cooked! Yes, technicalities of Asian hawker food!","569":"I have lived away for some 12 years and every time i come backto Singapore, which is about twice a year, i head straight here, the morning after my arrival, for my fav authentic hawker food. Each time, the noodles do not disappoint. The secret is in the mix: \u00a0the sacue is sufficiently vinegary and sweet and sallty, the ingredients are fresh and of good quality, and the noodles are always cooked just right. What really seals the deal for me is the stock which is amazing, Over the years the prices have escalated so that my visit each time runs up a bill close to $50, for two persons eating there and a to go order for three at home. Notwithstanding the prohibitive cost I return. MY one complaint right now is that for to go orders, they do not offer you the soup sp you have to purchase a soup bowl to go!","570":"Totally worth the wait and everytime I've been here, there will definitely be a wait.The crispy fried flatfish is what makes all TW difference for this bcm.Order a bowl of too soft but nonetheless tasty dumpling soup to round off your meal after all that waiting!","571":"First things first, the queue is VERY LONG. And it's not those fast moving queue, so you do need quite a bit of patience if you want to get a taste of this bar chor mee!My friend told me that the 'dry' one is what people think is the better one, so I tried it. But in my humble opinion, the soup one actually taste better overall. Nothing very spectacular in my opinion, so I'm not very sure if I'll come back, especially with such a long queue.............","572":"This stall was previously located in Marina Sq Food Court and always has a long queue for the bak chor mee. Even foreigners that come here want to try the noodles before they return to their countries.The special feature is the Chilli sauce and the flavourful soup! Their pig's liver is also done very nicely. Cooked for just the right amount of time, resulting is tender slices of liver heaven. I was sort of shocked when i saw that the whole bowl was filled with oil, but i was told that this is actually the yardstick for all Bak Chor Mees in Singapore. Anyway, i was not disappointed with the taste, not too salty and very flavourful with just a highlight of sourness coming from the vinegar.I also liked the fried bits of lard and the liver bits, which wasn't too overpowering and given in the correct amount. The crispy fish was also a nice addition to the usual bak chor mee dish. A must try.","573":"Hands down the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore. When it comes to flavor and freshness, Tai Hwa is hard to beat. Some people prefer their Bak Chor Mee to incorporate tomato based sauce, but my tastes are more aligned to the vinegar \/ chili heavy mix that Tai Hwa cooks up. The wontons, liver, meatballs and dried salted fish give the extra \"oomph\" that make the noodles truly a complete dish.","574":"I'd known before making my way down to Lavender that Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles was a popular bak chor mee stall, with some food bloggers going so far as to claim that it was the best bak chor mee stall in Singapore. I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here.Um sadly. Wasn't impressed.I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted.I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day.Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm.","575":"This is so underwhelming. I can't believe I queued 40 minutes for this during lunch time! It was time to see what's the fuss about when I decided to join the snaking queue in this coffeeshop tucked away in a sleepy estate of Crawford Lane. All I can say is I don't see what is so special about it. Add in the waiting time and I feel cheated. The noodles were quite stiff and starchy, and there was so much sole fish in it and too little minced pork.I had a better time with the homemade iced lemon tea from the same coffeeshop - be sure to order that if you need to try the noodles!","576":"Delicious minced meat noodles, but on the pricey side, starts from $5 to $10 a bowl. Not sure what lies in the $10 bowl but taste wise, it hits the BCM spot all the time. Long queues expected but moderately fast.","577":"The best minced pork noodle I have ever had. Other minced pork noodles no longer satisfy my cravings anymore since I have had this many years ago. Today, the noodles still taste as good as it was in the past. Love the fried flatfish and the wanton that comes with it.","578":"Fave bcm in town! but be prepared to queue for this, usually it will take me around 30-45 mins depending on the length of the queue and how many orders per person.","579":"Not sure what else I can say other than that this is most definitely the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore.Once you can get past the queue in this little kopitiam, you'll finally find yourself holding onto a bowl of the most perfectly cooked noodles, doused in a casually good vinegar base. One of the best parts of this is how well cooked their minced and sliced pork is - soo tender and juicy considering how fine they are. The pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it, and to crown it off, they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish, which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl. One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination! The soup on the side is so well brewed as well, you can actually taste the pork from which the flavour comes from. None of that artificial flavouring that we frown upon, I don't think!","580":"I accidentally found this place. I had a pork noodle. The portion of food is quite too big for a girl like me. The taste is unique and delicious. Love it!!","581":"Be prepared to queue. It is worth it. Is there a better pork noodle out there? Nope there never will be","582":"Hands down the best bak chor mee in Singapore! I love the vinegar with the chilli and so much porky goodness in the soup! Super long queue so make sure you bring some entertainment! Wait times can be up to one hour at peak times.","583":"This being my first time to Singapore \/ spending any meaningful time in Southeast Asia - a cuisine that I don't eat a whole lot of when I am home - has resulted in me trying to get a taste of the local cuisine as much as possible. Today took us to the Tiong Bahru Market, which I will say I enjoy much better than the Maxwell Center the day before - much more spacious, more seating, etc. Hong Heng is easy to find as it's the first place to the left once you go up the escalator to the second floor. The line moves relatively quickly, and ordering is simple: you can order a small, medium, or large portion, for S$3 at the smallest and moving up S$1 for each larger size. The serving isn't anything fancy - just a whole bunch of noodles on a flat plate (maybe a bowl would be a better way to serve), along with a small amount of spice on the side, as we requested it to be a bit more mild.I'm not sure if it's the oil\/broth that the noodles are cooked in, but wow - we wolfed this plate down as fast as humanly possible. They were so good and flavorful, and while some noodles (Asian, Italian pasta, or otherwise) can get a bit messy when they are inundated with liquid, these noodles were just filled with juicy, prawn-based goodness. The main drawback, surprisingly for me (as I'm not a fan of shrimp), is that we got 2 measly pieces of shrimp in the entire plate. We did order a small, but given the generous portion size on the noodles, I would have anticipated a bit more seafood.All in all, though, I really enjoyed the noodles here. There's a Bib Gourmand sticker on the stall, and IMO it is well-earned and deserved. Sometimes really good food can be simply done, and that is the way it certainly ends up here at Hong Heng.","584":"Tried this once a year or two ago, long before this stall was awarded a Michelin Bib Gourmand.I found this noodle to be pretty mediocre; it was just like a typical stir-fried plate of hokkien mee. Nothing particularly stood out in terms of taste profile, although I do recall them being generous when it came to its portion.This is not worth a Bib Gourmand for me. I argue that the much more commercialised Thye Hong Hokkien Mee is better, although this review may admittedly be slightly outdated. It is time to pay Tiong Bahru a visit again.","585":"While Fried Hokkien Mee may not be on my list of favourite foods, I love the plates of fried noodles dished out daily by the uncle from this stall and never fail to order it whenever I am in the area. The noodles are really fried here, unlike many stalls that just give it a little stir and serve it to you. The effort put into cooking up this brilliant plate of hokkien mee is evidenced by the great care taken by the uncle as he fries up a storm to ensure that the noodles take up the slightly charred flavour from the wok. The stock used is very flavourful, giving the noodles the fresh full flavour of prawns. They are also pretty generous with their prawns and sotongs and the seafoods served up are always fresh. Be sure to go there early for lunch if you wish to have a plate as they often sell out by 1pm.","586":"Visited this shop approximately a month ago, when the stall had been awarded a Michelin Bib Gourmand.The beef noodle was okay - nothing special. The highlight of the dish was actually the broth; I found it rich, aromatic and flavourful.Probably not worth a Bib Gourmand for me.","587":"You can't help but wish you'd eaten at Noodle Story, next door, instead. The broth is rich, but thats where the compliments end - the noodles have no bounce and the beef lacks texture. Not bad as such, just deeply underwhelming.","588":"They were awarded Bib Gourmand in Michelin Guide 2017, being one food of their Inspector's favourite being cheaper than SGD 40 (I believe). However, the food here rather disappointing. I'm actually in shock when I realised that there's no queue at a Michelin-recognised stall on a weekday's lunch hours. Something isn't right isn't?Speaking about the food, I had the Dry Beef Noodle at the Owner's recommendation. Recognition has to be given to their beef (slices of meat) and beefballs, it is really well-cooked and remained very tender.Other than that, it's rather on the poor side. Noodles and the sauce has no taste or flavouring whatsoever, it tastes bland. The \"supposed-to-be\" aromatic soup was also bland on my visit. Chilli sauce is yet another disappointment. A conclusion would be: It's worthy to give it a miss!Visited 12 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Beef Noodle-Dry (SGD 6.00) - Nothing big to shout about.","589":"just had lunch here today. \u00a0 obviously something reallybgoos or really bad will prompt me to feed back. \u00a0 actually not been to amoy FC for a long time so decide to check out local blogger who recommended this shop. \u00a0 now that i know it is on the michelin guide it is even more disappointing. \u00a0 beef tough, sauce no kick and noodle way over cooked. \u00a0 interesting to note during busy weekday lunch there is no Q and i thought i was in trouble and i did. \u00a0 surely the one at Ion food republic is far better though more expensive.","590":"Worthy selection to Singapore Michelin Guide. The teochew minced meat is amazing all for about $3-$4 a bowl.","591":"Stumbled upon Hup Hup and noticed the press coverage posted on their stall. I decided to give it a try since it was off-peak hours with no queue at all. In the end, I wasn't disappointing. \u00a0Many pluses for this bowl of bak chor mee. First, the texture of the noodles is really appealing. It's got a good springy bite and grabs the sauce well. Also generous ingredients from minced pork to pig's liver, and sliced mushrooms. The standout for me is the fried wonton skins. At first seemingly extraneous given its just fried wonton wrappers without any filling, they lend the dish a nice texture contrast. The only drawback for me was the sauce. I prefer mine to be on the \u00a0vinegary side and Hup Hup uses a good deal of tomato ketchup. But having tried their version, I wish I could bring the fried wonton skins to some of my favorite vinegary bak chor mee places and we have a win-win!All up though, Hup Hup still offers a decent bowl of bak chor mee and you get pretty generous portions for the $3-4 a bowl.","592":"This review is long overdue as its been a couple years since I went to Iggy's, but still think fondly about the meal and recommend it to everyone I know who is coming to Singapore. Ive eaten at many Michelin-rated restaurants and I found the vegetarian menu at Iggy's to be exceptional. I was especially blown away by the tomato-garlic \"beer\" - it looked magical and tasted even better. Service was impeccable. I appreciated they allowed us to split a wine pairing between the two of us, as we were worried about having too much to drink and not remembering the meal - ha!I loved that the glass to the kitchen changed so that you could sometimes see the action in the spotless kitchen. The location is a bit odd - its tucked away upstairs in a strange part of the hotel. I recommended just asking someone who works there for directions. My only complain is that the restrooms are outside the restaurant, adjacent to the event space for the hotel. The night we were there it was some kind of prom (?) so the restrooms were chaotic and filled with loud teenagers, while the restaurant was a peaceful, elegant affair. It did make me laugh. :-)Make reservations early - its a small space. You wont be disappointed!","593":"I have always wondered why Iggy's is rated one of the top restaurants in Singapore, yet never got a star in the recent Michelin guide for Singapore...I was taken here on a lazy Saturday lunch for two, and we got the $105 per person 4-course menu. I started with tune tartare on avocado, and it was well-executed, smoky and ocean-tasting enough. I then had the carabineros rice, which was thinly sliced raw carabinero prawns on a red risotto, which must have had some of the tomalley cooked in. This was not to my taste - the bite of the rice was too al dente for me. I had the wagyu flank for the third course, and I did like this, but it was two miserly cubes... Sadness. Dessert rounded off the meal - mango and a coconut sorbet. While it was yummy, it was nothing special.We also had the petit fours which were some macarons and jellies.My favorite bit of the meal was actually the amuse bouche, which included a tomato meringue sandwiching some cheese and basil (meant to be a Caprese salad), which completely surprised me as I bit into it, with its tanginess and complete rounding of flavors from a tiny morsel. What I would have loved to see more of this innovative spirit.I do have to qualify my review, with the fact that the Iggy's chef has now changed, and I had this meal in December 2016 (yes I know my review is a wee bit late).","594":"Haven't been here for many years.First time it was above average, second time it was fantastic and this third time is such a disappointment.Don't understand how they earned their Michelin Star.Decor and ambience plain.Tableware plain.Food so so. Nothing memorable.Main was Hidea Wagyu Sirloin - served medium rare, wasn't really warm.","595":"Frankly was a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed Iggy's despite reading the negative Yelp and blog reviews about the place beforehand. However, the price point is insanely high for flavors that you can find at other a la carte restaurants and for that reason, I would not recommend Iggy's for that perfect date night or family dinner unless you've already tried all the rest of the top SG restaurants and are looking for something new. You are spending the same amount that you would at the likes of Andre, Corner House and Jaan to say the least, each of which provides a very unique experience that you would get ONLY if you went to those particular restaurants - going beyond the \"pay to eat at a fancy restaurant\" mentality but rather to leave you remembering it. Nevertheless, I did enjoy Iggy's but the price point is just too high for the lack of an experience.Iggy's and Les Amis are the last two of the stupid Asia Top 50 List I haven't tried in Singapore so wanted to have a bite at Iggy's.You walk into a dramatic doorway that I thought was really cool followed by a long dark hallway and into a very small dining room with 6 fairly small although comfortable tables. They have a good number of staff so you know you should be well taken care of (they wear their 5 Star Forbes pins prominently). You receive the tasting menu options which you pick either the Gastronomic full 5 course tasting or the smaller 3 course (I believe) as well as the wine\/drink iPad. The wine list was very French wine heavy and I felt was lacking as was their cocktail and drink menu. We did do a \"half bottle\" of a nice Spanish Tempranillo, however, where instead of opening a half bottle of wine, they use their Coravin device - something I feel is more appropriate for doing high end wine by the glass rather than saying you are selling a \"half bottle.\" Felt a bit ripped off.We opted for the full Gastronomic Menu and were presented with the following:- Snacks - you get a few pre courses which include a platter with a bunch of charcoal stones where only two are edible. Some kind of potato which was cool but a bit bland of flavor. Then was a sea urchin cone which I thought was a bit fishy (we are big uni fans in any sushi restaurant). Then you get a pretty good oyster covered in squid ink snack. Lastly there was a nice soba noodle topped with caviar and lemongrass that you eat in a single bite along with either a foie gras fried ball or a fried ebi ball (if you don't like foie gras like me).- Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio - Loved the flavor although something seemed off. I felt that I'm not the biggest fan of how the watermelon and scallop were the same room temperature together but it was beautifully presented and it was a nice concept.- Purple Asparagus - Nice dish and beautifully presented- Smoked Spanish Mackerel - This is served with crab risotto and bonito \"ash\" or powder. I was very happy with this dish and for sure would be something I would order a la carte. Even though I loved this dish, the flavor was not anything revolutionary - it was a nicely done fish on top of risotto.- For the main course you have the option of a rabbit stew ($225), lamb ($250) or Hida Waygu Striploin ($275) where I'm sure the majority of people would opt for the latter and better sounding option. We did that and we were definitely happy with that option. We loved it.- For dessert they had a pretty incredible looking \"Strawberry\" - a huge red sugar coated and crafted strawberry looking thing that was REALLY COOL. Inside of this thing (see picture) was milk ice cream, shiso and tomato. That's where my problem was - why for a beautiful creation like this that's supposed to be that perfect dessert would you have TOMATO AND SHISO??? Something was off about it and that was exactly it. Cool idea except if it's called Strawberry, I was expecting a really cool Strawberries and Cream that didn't come to surface.-They had a second dessert which was really cool and was a jackfruit ice cream sandwich which I thought was really nice and creative. Love when restaurants use local ingredients and flavors.Fortunately I didn't get any of those courses that I saw from previous Yelpers that looked like someone randomly through a bunch of crap on a dish randomly and presented it as a course. All of my courses were very nicely presented.Coffee and tea are included in the meal which was another cool perk.Service was great and I had no issues with the environment or tableware as another has mentioned. It was very comfortable.I enjoyed myself during this meal but for this price point, I really would not recommend Iggy's. It just wasn't memorable as other Yelpers mentioned. It will be interesting to see what Michelin does with this one next month.","596":"For fine dining, I'm not impressed at all. The Manfriend and I came here for his birthday celebration. The service was fine, but I'm indifferent towards the ambiance and disappointed by the food. Iggy's has about 10 tables and half these tables were empty--it felt as if I was dining in a deserted restaurant...or a library. There was no music! Hence, Manfriend and I felt like we needed to whisper the entire meal. We ordered the gastronomic 7 course...meh. Out of the 7 dishes, we only enjoyed 2. The first was the burrata with tomato and the second was a striploin, flown in from Japan. You cant' go wrong with these dishes...all the others, the sea urchin, foie gras, tile fish, snacks...forgettable. For a meal over $700, I expected much better.","597":"For a fine dining establishment, I expected top notch service such as napkin placement when you are seated, napkin folded when you leave your seat, and a better explanation of each dish. \u00a0BIG PEEVED: the gentlemen next to us, used his cell phone twice, w\/the second call put on speaker. I expect the staffs to note this inappropriate behavior and would ask the guy to take his phone call outside. It's like would you take a call during the movies? I expect a story for each dish but got a generic summary of the list of ingredients. For example, the garden plate had 20 vegetables imported from Japan. Each vegetable was scattered throughout the plate. Was I suppose to mix the vegetable w\/the watermelon burrata gazpacho? Or, eat each vegetable individually? If I should eat each vegetable individually, where do I start? Presentation for this dish was a hot mess (see pic).Next dish: uni w\/seared scallop green pea soup. The protein in this dish was good by itself but the pea consume broth fell flat. The slimy texture from the eggplant and the blanched peas was a bad combination put together. Onto Iggy's signature dish is the Cappellini with sakura ebi. Nothing UMAMI about this dish except that is was under season. Final dish is the duo wagyu with the poached squid ink egg and black truffle. This was the only dish that was good, and was gastronomist for the '$275 gastronomist' prefix dinner. The Japanese and Australian wagyu were cooked well, and I admire the skilled to deep fry a poached egg in squid ink. The shaved truffle enhanced the natural flavors of the beef.The gratin lychee Japanese melon dessert was better than the main dessert. The main dessert reminded me of a blood splatter scene from Dexter (see pic). Overall, save yourself the money and book elsewhere. Or, treat yourself to a Hermes bracelet. Bad planning on my part.","598":"Iggy's wears many hats - top restaurant in Singapore, best 50 in the world.. etc. Unfortunately I don't find it quite deserving the hype. Maybe its was the wrong occasion - we came here for Valentine's day. The menu was different from their normal tasting. It was six courses, tho we couldn't find some of the classics, such as the \"rock potatoes\" on the menu. Here are the six courses:1. Snacks 2. Double belly (raw toro belly + pork belly)3. Lobster ravioli4. Mackerel and brussel sprouts5. Wagyu duo (Japanese and Australian)6. Dessert - Red hot molten passion.One thing I noticed in many dishes is their love for playing with the texture. For example, one of the snacks consisted of jello(I think cucumber?), avocado, and crab meat. A very similar combination was repeated later in the meal. The cooking method in most dishes are more traditional and classic, we didn't get much foamy, decomposed, or reconstituted ingredients. In terms of highlights during the meal, for me they were the double belly and double wagyu. I might be biased because toro and pork belly are two of my favorite things in the world. The pork belly dish came out in a wrapped up plastic bag, a specially material that can withstand up to 200 degree of heat. To taste, they first cut into the bag to let the aroma out. With black truffle, asparagus, and a clear chicken broth, the aroma truly stimulate your senses. The other dishes were a bit lackluster. Their homemade ravioli wasn't thin enough, the mackerel was a bit salty and nothing special. The other thing we didn't like was their pace of serving. Interval between courses were very short that we feel like we constantly have food in front of us. I am having a hard time justify the cost of the meal. For the same price (or a bit higher), we used to find much worthier meals in the States - Alinea, Eleven Madison, Le Bernadin. Not sure if we will be back.","599":"Iggy's is just Amazing!! No wonder it is the Top restaurant in Singapore and Asia, and Top 50 in the world.Even after we spend $85++ pp having the prestige of having their lunch tasting menu here, I have to say I think is money well spent and I will gladly come back again next time when I am in town.Everything is just perfect here. From the deco, the services and the food.4 courses tasting menu with options for you to choose from, changes regularly!Starter:CaviarAppetizer:Duck\/Foie GrasFirst Course:Steamed Egg\/CappelliniMain Course:Kinmedai\/PigeonDessert:Spicy Mango\/CaramelEvery single course all nicely plated, well balanced in taste and complex in texture. An excellent example of French and Japanese Fusion.Dress Code in Effect: No shorts during lunch.. but the staff handled it gracefully even when my Yelp friend waltzed into the restaurant with his shorts...* The most expensive lunch specials I ever had... but still a bargain compare to dinner at $195++, but worth that price tag for this gastronomic experience!","600":"KenScale: 8.0\/10In the middle of April, I visited Singapore with my brother and had an opportunity to check out some of the top restaurants there. Singapore is quite a gastronomic juggernaut in Asia. You can sample various local food (drawing from the influences of China, Malaysia and India) in the so-called hawker centers around the city, and the presence of affluent people means that there are also quite a few high-end places featuring unique haute cuisine. My first stop was a lunch at Iggy's, which has long been one of the top restaurants in Singapore. Located at Hilton Hotel, Iggy's features globally influenced cuisine drawing inspirations from Europe and Japan. Overall, I had a pleasant meal at the restaurant.For lunch, you can go with three-course menu (starting at S$85 per person), four-course menu (starting at S$105 per person) or go all-out with signature tasting menu (starting at S$105 per person). I opted for the four-course menu, which consists of tuna tartare, spaghettini, a main course of pork, wagyu or lamb and a dessert (the restaurant had three options to choose from). The first course of tuna tartare started out with a bang. I was startled to see the smoke emanating from the mascarpone cheese that accompanied the dish, but the cold texture was quite unique and worked fabulously with tuna. Spaghettini that came with crab and tomato was an above-average pasta dish that had very nice balance of flavor. The main courses were somewhat underwhelming, although by no means bad. My brother and I ordered wagyu and lamb, each accompanied by grilled vegetables of shiitake, potato, nanohana, tomato and lotus root. While wagyu was very nicely cooked, I felt the seasoning was somewhat uneven. Lamb, on the other hand, had texture that was tougher than I had expected. For desserts, we proceeded to share berry & berries that came with cheese, milk and cherry, a very light and refreshing dish, and kaya & the tarik with Ceylon tea flavored ice cream that was quite pleasant and soothing. The restaurant has a formal but not stuffy vibe with professionally dressed and attentive staff. There are some nice wine selections (although I was surprised to see the stiff price for a glass, which runs at around S$30 per glass). Overall, Iggy's had some nice dishes with unique gastronomic concepts and deserves a visit when you are in Singapore.","601":"Had a lovely lunch here in September 15 accompanied by a delicious Burgundy. Not cheap but that's not why you would go here. It's on level 3 of the Hilton on Orchard Rd. No natural lighting inside so no view. Wait staff were impeccable. They have their wine list on an iPad which is cool .","602":"Was overall underwhelmed.Have eaten at waku ghin, tippling club, andre, etc. \u00a0and was really a bit meh about the the iggy's experience compared with the others.The dining room was small and pleasant but a couple was speaking overly loudly and walking around to look at (and to my horror- occasionally touch) the art. \u00a0None of the waiters or hosts did anything to stop them. (-1 star)The service was excellent (for singapore, my water glass spent a fair amount of time empty) , and the food solid but there are many better tasting menus at the price. \u00a0The dishes were solid, but not that creative. \u00a0Also the execution of a few were unimpressive (overcooked wagyu). \u00a0I get the impression that the staff and chef are resting on their laurels.this isn't to say it was a bad meal by any stretch, but at ~$275pp there's no excuse for any mistakes","603":"This is a review of a dinner date at Iggy's.I want to say this was a true dining experience. \u00a0it was very enjoyable. \u00a0Is it a top fifty restaurant in the world experience? \u00a0I sincerely doubt it. \u00a0However, someone thinks so and whether it is or isn't doesn't diminish from the experience we had.tinyurl.com\/c3golwvAmbiance - There is something a little mysterious about entering Iggy's \u00a0It also seems like there are alternate areas. \u00a0The space we were in was a mid to small square room. \u00a0It actually had the feel of a temporary space. \u00a0it was quite nice. \u00a0But, it didn't really have a feel of cohesion. \u00a0I am certainly not sure why they selected the 60's\/70's style swivel chairs.Service - The service was excellent. \u00a0I truly mean excellent. \u00a0It was reserved. \u00a0It was calculated. \u00a0It was precise. \u00a0The meal moved at a very controlled pace with each dish accompanied by a whispered description. \u00a0 They also agreed to substitute for the foie gras course. \u00a0I choose not to eat it. \u00a0Recently, my dinner date has been doing the same.Food - The food ranged from very good to excellent. \u00a0This is a very varied dining experience. \u00a0I do not think it can be expected that each person is going to necessarily find each and every course to their specific liking. \u00a0However, you can appreciate the execution and quality of ingredients for each dish.I am not going to try to critique each dish. \u00a0 I think there is a great deal of personal taste involved in traversing a varied menu of this type.They offer two set menus. \u00a0We each selected the Dinner Gastronomic ($276 per person), \u00a0There is also a lighter version, Dinner Tasting ($195 per person). \u00a0You can also select a vegetarian set menu. \u00a0 One note, each person has to order the same set course. \u00a0This was not an issue for us but it could have been. \u00a0It is something to keep in mind.I will now list the courses and provide links to the Yelp photos for each course. \u00a0 I have marked my five favourite non-dessert courses with \u00a0an \u00a0(*) and my favourite dessert course with an (+).*1st course - Snow crab, banana & 2nd course Somen, caviartinyurl.com\/c2kkk4t3rd course - Iggy's Sushitinyurl.com\/c6r79ht4th course- Nasi Lemaktinyurl.com\/bokt8on5th course - Gillardeau Oyster (Tomato gazpacho, caviarroli, fine herbs)tinyurl.com\/cd8sl3m*6th course - Chlorophyl (Sean and soil salad)tinyurl.com\/cawngb37th course - Sea Urchin (Turnip, Alba black truffle)tinyurl.com\/cllpsww*8th course Sakura Ebi (Cappellini, shellfish oil, konbu)tinyurl.com\/br4nths*9th course Red Rockfish (Vegetable brunaise, Jamon Iberico, sudachi)tinyurl.com\/c9zzuqq*10th course Wagyu (Nanohana, nasu)tinyurl.com\/bm84j92+ Dessert #1 - Forest Berries (Campari, blood orange, mascarpone)tinyurl.com\/c5m4qhlDessert #2 - Pumpkin (Spiced sponge cake, chocolate, pecans)tinyurl.com\/c84ykxuDessert #3 - Hinoki Chocolate Box (Selection of home-made chocolates and macaroons)tinyurl.com\/cm4fq3pReceipt ($946.31 for two people)tinyurl.com\/d5uhzk4Overall - The food is extremely good and the presentation is consistently beautiful. \u00a0The ambiance is very nice but lacked some cohesion. \u00a0It felt a little like a catered \u00a0banquet room. \u00a0The service was truly exceptional. \u00a0I went back and forth on whether this was a five star or four star experience.

The ambience was stuffy and prissy, much like dining with the Queen. That was far from enjoyable. To compound its stodgy, chi-chi vibe, the food was inventive but contrived, delicious but soulless.We had the extravagant but substantive $275 11-course dinner: 1) Stone and Pate - comprised a couple of baby potatoes, skins-on and charred into a stone-like appearance, sided by a truffle mayonnaise dip. Served amongst a bunch of actual smoothened stones, it's quite the inspired plating. 2) Octopus Carpaccio showered with edible flowers and snow: delicate and evoked memories of a crisp winter's morning, just after the first snowfall.3) Mushroom Consomme dotted with shimeiji caps, and floating above a smooth egg custard: comforting and lovely4) Burnt Scallop -encrusted in an inky casing, revealed a plump succulent scallop: well-balanced against a curried tomato sauce.5) Toro Sashimi, with beetroot, arugula, baby carrot, mascarpone powder: a wonderful medley of the sweet, peppery, creamy and bitter.6) Anago with green pea, fava bean, and urui: uneven, the nutty undertones of the greens did little to compensate for the overwhelmingly fishy eel.7) Spaghetti, with shirako, kujo-neghi, sansho, and yuzu: the fish overwhelmed its delicate counterparts, and copious lashings of yuzu zest and fresh leek failed to save the day.8) Wagyu: absolutely sublime, complemented by a capered jus laced with alba black truffles. This was accompanied by grilled fat stalks of white asparagus, new potatoes and shitake.9) Kurobuta Pork: glorious as well, with nary a whiff of that \"porky smell\", lush and fork-tender.","605":"Been here and it was not well worth for the money. My fiance was very disappointed when they served you a plate of raw green leaves...","606":"went here with 2 of my good friend with high expectation as iggy's is one of the top restaurants in asia.we went here for lunch, go for the 85++ and i have to say its memorable superb yummy lunch that i had. 3 of us enjoyed our lunch so much and would like to come back again for sure. especially the teh tarik ice cream with kaya and toasted bread for dessert which was just amazing.ignatius chan, the chef behind iggys, is so humble and very kind . he was the one who lead us to the the table.thanks iggy's . you're the best !","607":"Unimpressed. Came here for my bday dinner celebration with hubby, but we should've just revisited Jaan instead. We opted for the Gastronmic Menu at $275\/person (the menu can be found online), and other than the \"burnt oyster' dish, everything else on the course menu was uncreative and just not. that. good.enough. for a restaurant of its standing. \u00a0We probably had similar and better dishes at casual restaurants. Located in a run-down hilton hotel next to Far East Plaza, the location is meh, though the interior decor of the place was private and classy and perfect for a special celebration. and this is not a big deal, but i didn't like it that the bathroom was located OUTSIDE of the restaurant to be shared with other hotel visitors. You charge fine dining price, and while I will not expect a towel lady to be present to hand out my hand towels as they do in many of Seoul\/New York fine dining, I expect the bathroom to be inside the restaurant, easily acessibie, and with similar classy decor. Other turn-offs:-I told the waitress no-alcohol in any of the dishes for personal reasons. She said Plum Soda in one of the dishes has alcohol in it, and that she'd have it replaced with something else. And yet, there it was, Plum Soda along with my other dish. The waitress quickly apologized and brought out another dish. -Our wagyu was not tender; it was tough and chewy.-The waiter that explains each of our courses changed each time. Sometimes it was a girl, then it was a guy, then it was another guy, and most of the time, I couldn't really make out what they were saying. The girl was more helpful than the men that served us, though.-It was obvious they forgot it was my birthday, although my hubby stated it in the email exchanges in making our reservation. When my husband asked for the check and finally asked about the whereabouts, the waiter lied and said it'll be out in another minute. After we get our check, really? At least be honest about it. Then I go see him talking to another waiter in a hurry, and it took another 15 min for us just waiting around for them to bring out some pathetic little chocolate ball they called a bday dessert with a lit candle. Fail.-Not a big deal, but their bread and chocolate selections are not expansive. and they only come around once. Yes I really miss the real fine dining back at home. Finally, one thing that really annoys me about Singapore's fine dining in genereal is that they are so stingy with their portions and they nickel and dime you. Portion-wise, I understand. This is Asia and I don't expect you to fully satisfy me as New York fine dining does for their diners truly looking for a dining experience (though you charge as expensive). But the fact that they come over during mid-meal and ask us if we'd either like Coffee or Tea, and THEN CHARGE US for it (not sure how much, around 8~15 per cup?) is beyond ridiculous. I ordered a course meal and in that, a tea and\/or coffee should be included, as it is in all the other fine dining I've tried across America and Korea. We got hit with their sneaky tactic last time at another Singapore fine dining so we made sure to ask if it was complimentary, which it wasn't. Pretty sad that they try to nickel and dime you when it's usually something that accomapnies desserts in course meals. Or seriously, don't come over randomly and ask me if i want something if you are going to charge me for it.Iggy's was supposely voted one of the top 50 best restaurants in Asia, and prior to our dinner we were wondering why it hadn't earned a Michelin yet. Now we know. the end.","608":"It's hard to proclaim any restaurant in Singapore as \"the best\" if you haven't yet tried Iggy's. For many, Iggy's sets the bar for top tier dining locally, and really it's not difficult to see why.The food here is not only delicious and well executed, but it's witty, intelligent, and very often pleasantly surprising. I don't mean the cheap gimmicks like the rehydrating finger towels that expand upon the additional of water that starts off your meal... no. I mean little surprises like the White Chocolate Truffle actually being scented with truffles. There are other little surprises that you'll encounter through the meal that play with your expectations and ideas of what a dish should be like, but I won't spoil any of the other surprises here.Service was actually a little lacklustre here, staff weren't incredibly well versed in their wine list, there were little lapses in attention, but at Iggy's the food often makes up for any shortfall anywhere else. Expect to have your tastebuds tickled and your senses toyed with, but do not expect that any complexity of flavour or execution of technique will be compromised as a result. Everything at Iggy's is elegantly done, and even with the dinner costing over $400 a head, we still felt it was very much worth it.","609":"I have wanted to go to Iggy's for a long time, especially since becoming aware that this restaurant in little Singapore is among the World's 50 Best. I was extremely lucky to be given a lunch treat at Iggy's last Thursday, and I'm glad to say that it lived up to the expectations. The decor is all slick black and very minimalistic. The staff is present but not in your face. The 4-course menu offers good variety, though I find it quite meat-centric. We started with an amuse bouche of Tomato Essence, with foam of tomato, tomato concasse & tomato\/bell pepper cream. It was smooth, refreshing and flavoursome. I had the Gillardeau Oysters with Caviar, and my friend had the Foie Gras. Both were truly sublime. Main courses were Wagyu with Madeira Sauce and I had the Pigeon with Lentils, very classic. The pigoen is well cooked, though I find the accompaniment of cooked beetroot and beetroot puree a little on the sweet-side. Dessert of Kaya & Teh Tarik was a little disappointing. The dish was somehow a little disjointed. My Forest Berries with Campari jelly, blood orange sorbet with mascarpone was on the other hand, very balanced flavours.Having eaten in other restaurants in that list in Europe, it's hard not to compare. However, would it be fair? Probably not. The cooking is definitely well executed and service is faultless. Plus the fact that they served a really yummy sparkling sake that was delicious with the oysters. I would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant.","610":"Love. Love that there are so crazy lines (like paradise dynasty at ion or the ding-tai-fengs), love that the food is awesome, love that the price is reasonable and love that there is amazing service!We have tried so many dishes over multiple visits. Imperial treasure restaurants are great in maintaining consistencies and great food at fair prices. This is definitely one of my favorites in the chain (their super Peking duck at Paragon tops this for me). Soup dumpling (the Xiao long baos) are the best in the city (in my opinion!) beautifully thin translucent skin, wrapped around a sweet rich meaty broth and meat. It's even better than those in the famed Ding-tai-fengs. The other ala carte dishes are mostly great. Noodle dishes are good too, since it's a Shanghainese restaurant after all.And they take reservations! So save your time and come get your soup dumplings here.","611":"Really nice food, good quality and in a pleasant ambience. Had the Xiao long Bao which were excellent - in my opinion better than Din Tai Fung. Skin was translucent thin and filling \/ gravy was tastier than DTF. Noodle dishes were good too - no overpowering flavours or greasiness. We had two noodles, a Xiao long Bao and a pot of tea for $33, which was very reasonable I think.","612":"great food, great ambience, great new restaurant from one of my two favorite restaurant groups in singapore (paradise group being the other).this is a new one, like I've said - focusing on shanghai food, duh - and I do rather like how they have these themes\/ genres\/ regions associated with each one of their restaurants. it makes for such varied eating, especially since many chinese restaurants are mostly a variant on cantonese (nothing wrong in itself, but variety is lovely).shanghainese food is a little stronger in flavor, sauces are darker, dishes are saltier, garlic makes a significant appearance, and it's all good.this restaurant, as with the imperial treasure teochew (coming up!) and imperial treasure super peking duck, is done up all posh and luxe. I believe it might be the (or second to) the top tier in terms of marketing and pricing in the group - and all are darnably enjoyable to dine in.they have an eye for intimate, cosy, dark spaces - lit enough in white light so you get to see your food, but dark enough for a bit of comfortable chatting. this one here also has wooden pod-like booths on the perimeter that seem good enough for four (maybe less if you order as much as we do) and are rather aesthetically gorgeous.it certainly doesn't hurt that the food is delicious too, like our starters of jellyfish head (I almost always order this - and definitely order it if they serve up the head, which is satisfyingly crunchier than the tentacles) and julienned vegetables. both had a good dose of sesame oil and the right amount of salt - and such textures: crunchy jellyfish and fresh crisp greens.the beef dish that followed was silky, tender beef sauteed with even silkier softened lees - and so good. I have to say though, that we've never been disappointed by beef at the imperial treasure restaurants - it's always tender without any mushy, beefy without any gaminess, and softly chewy without gristle.while my parents were having their double-boiled soups (always a god order), I took a leap of faith with this sauteed eel dish - and landed safely with eel slivers stir-fried in a dark savory sauce, topped with minced fresh garlic.eel is a very fishy fish, and skin on - as it was here - its flavor can be rather prominent\/ pungent. both words can be applied to minced fresh garlic too, but the two complemented\/ tempered harmoniously. still a strong-tasting dish (best with rice), but with enough exoticism and tastiness to try.two more: soft yellow cabbage braised with yunnan ham, and young peas with bouncy fresh shrimp.completely opposite spectrums in terms of taste and texture, but I'd be hard pressed to pick one over the other.and, we finished with three desserts.osmanthus jelly, fragrant and lightly perfumed, and dotted through with plump wolfberries.red bean pancake, crisp with a thin layer of bean paste and barely greasy (which is quite a feat for this dish).and according to my sister, the best pumpkin pancake ever. it's actually a nian gao (chinese sticy rice cake, or chinese new year cake) colored orange with pumpkin, and pan-fried. I actually couldn't taste the pumpkin, but it was certainly a good specimen of its class regardless - and came thin enough so it doesn't get cloying.it's obvious I like the food eh? so I leave you with the photos - and a recommendation to visit as soon as you can. great for dates, for family meals and business dining - and it's seldom one place is appropriate for all three.","613":"$1.60 is an absurdly cheap price for one of the best things I've eaten in Singapore.The Crispy Black Pepper Chicken puffs are so fluffy and \u00a0delicious. A perfect crispy outside texture - which flakes enough, but not too much - mixed with succulent chicken in a delicious black pepper sauce.The generic chicken potato curry puff was nice and - for $1.40 - great value. But the Black Pepper is the star. They could have charged triple and it would still have been fair.","614":"What a wonderful experience. All of the staff were brilliant, with our hostess providing a delightfully quirky approach that helped us relax and settle in to enjoy the theatre that is Jaan. We went for the 5 course option, but with all the treats and delights, this really becomes more like 10. Even though it's degustation and the servings appear small, over the course of the meal you finished sated and your taste buds have truly experience an extraordinary variety.After enjoying the truly amazing culinary delights, to have Chef Kirk drop by for a chat was a highlight. Thank you for making mum's 80th birthday lunch such a memorable moment.","615":"Totally lived up to the hype. Not cheap. Bill for three was a thousand dollars!. Sans wine, just a couple of cocktails. The elements of the menu just kept coming. We did the 7 course menu having learnt that the 10 course only added a few more cheese and desert elements. The core of the menu is the same but with 70 dollars more per person. The seven course ended up being an 11 course. We got a \"chef special small bites\" to open, then a series of extra desserts, and a sizable birthday cake. The egg in an egg was my least favorite. The service was impeccable, professional, and polite. Very impressed. The view was amazing.Ambiance: 10\/10Noise level 10\/10. Ten being the quietest.Taste: 8\/10Flavor: 8\/10Service:9\/10Return factor: 8\/10Recommend: 9\/10.","616":"For the price and this being a Michelin star restaurant I really expected more from it.The service was attentive and really on the ball, the view of the city from the 70th floor was also very nice. The food though, for what we paid I was expecting each and every item to knock my socks off. The most underwhelming thing was the bread. Of all of the French restaurants I have been to located in Cali, NYC, Vegas and France they all have many different types and varieties of bread. This place just had one type, a wheat sour dough and didn't taste good.I think the best part of the meal was the dessert as all of the items didn't go well together and flavors were a bit off.Don't think I will come back to this place even if it were free.","617":"Wasn't at all memorable. Chef did his obligatory visit at each table including mine, and wasn't at all phased that I told him that nothing in his menu really stood out.Not only did they forgot about me when I checked in at the front desk, but my view of the city was severely obstructed by another couple. I guess that's what you get for being a single diner. And oh by the way...I'm pretty sure I had more drinks, and a better menu selection than that couple...so if you think of it as a price per person per table ratio...I'm pretty sure I had them beat, and I could have had a better view with my average meal.Several other window side tables were empty up until I had my last few courses, so I was baffled on how they manage the table system.Bitter much? Yep. And thanks for asking me how my meal was throughout the experience (insert sarcasm here)...and not just at the end by the Chef.","618":"Wow.How to describe this experience? Hard, with words.Best start at the beginning.I booked some weeks ago, the occasion being my hubbies birthday. In my first inquiry I also stated that I'd love a window table which wasn't available any longer - we would be kept on the waiting list.Also, they offered a complimentary birthday cake and I was able to chose up to 4 words on it.The entire booking process was very smooth, once I chose a menu (3 menus available, you have to choose one of them per table beforehand), I gave our dietary requirements and the wording on the cake, I had also asked about dress code (men with long trousers- jeans are ok - and long sleeved shirts, ladies elegant), and my contact Patricia was very professional and friendly.When I arrived on the night, prior to my husband, I was welcomed by Patricia - so nice seeing my email-contact in person, she was lovely - and led to a window table, yay! (Surprise! was her reaction :-))My husband arrived and we ordered champagne by the glass, received the amuse bouche, followed by choosing a white wine. This being the only element of the night I wasn't too pleased with as it did not taste at all like the sommelier described - but that's subjective and did not diminish the overall experience.The pace at which the 5 course menu was then served suited us fine: faster in the beginning and slower toward the end. We were famished and devoured the bread offered so we were glad for food arriving smoothly.The food.. a feast for the eyes every single time, and quite a show as well (dry ice helps) - with the items on each plate being arranged in the perfect order, to be scooped up just as is - for the most delectable combination of flavour and aromas.I have seldom had such a combination of different cooking styles (fermentation, slow cooking, raw food..) that went so well together.Personally, I do not believe much in overly \"experimental\" or molecular cooking as I want to eat properly when I'm hungry and enjoy great quality combined with creative excellency, as is the case with chef Kirk Westaway's cooking.Oh, and chef stepped out of the kitchen to present dessert himself, spraying warm chocolate mousse (to die for) into a 'variation of chocolate' bowl, asking everyone how they liked their food. Needless to say, my hubbies' birthday cake, which was served at the end, was most delectable - we had it at home the next day.I cannot wait for the next occasion that justifies the expense for an evening at JAAN :-)","619":"A epic journey of 7 highly creative and flavoursome courses was enjoyed while perched on a window side table on the 75th floor.JAAN is elegant and delicious modern French \u00a0fare that is part art and part science. \u00a0From the artisan breads to 45 minute poached egg, perfect snapper, and baked pigeon (if it can't be prepared well here, where can it be?), the cuisine was top shelf. \u00a0The desserts were deliciously rich and ample, and the view was the best way to appreciate the utter vibrancy that is packed into this island country of Singapore.Low point - 'House' champagne starts from $50 a glass.High point - A lifetime memory of the finest and most picturesque dining experience.","620":"Beautiful view, beautiful restaurant decor, beautiful looking food, and maybe romantic for a date, which basically descibes jaan. But that's about it. Been here twice for dinner & lunch & ordered the full chef's signatures menu each time. Dishes are decent, use high quality ingredients & taste light on the palate, but nothing exciting, nor interesting even though some of them had truffle & truffle jus.Service is as expected for a fine dining establishment. Staff are friendly & attentive. However, during my lunch, they were supposed to serve petit fours & they forgot to serve it until i asked!For the price, lunch is always a better value but i would recommend other better restaurants in singapore other than jaan for a good time with better tasting dishes. Definitely not 1 of the best restaurants in singapore despite being on Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list.","621":"To say Kirk Westaway is a storyteller is an understatement. He spins fairytales. His attention to details, the subtlety and balance in his pretty dishes, the overall ebb and flow, ups and downs, and then that happily ever after that ended on the perfect note.. Needless to say, i was won over dish after dish during my 4 hour long 10 course dinner. Julien may be the punchy one, but you'll never get sick of Kirk and you'd want more of his dishes.The first serving of Wagyu beef tartare, with a clever \"Fish & Chips\" (done a la French fine dining), a foie gras and truffle macaron (salty, creamy, sweet and chewy), and an olive cracker with olive pur\u00e9e and cheddar cheese (superbly crumbly). You know this Briton has a sense of humor with this French rendition of English food.Then came the best onion brioche i've tasted. Those layers and that subtle onion flavor..From the land, we dived right into the ocean with the Majestic Irish Oyster (from Donegal) with Artichoke cream, and 'Oscietra' caviar. Loved the creamy, plump and firm texture of the Irish oyster, which was balanced with the slightly nutty Artichoke cream. And then you have those pops of the sea as the caviar bursts. Then it was back to more refreshing bites with the Tomato Collection. Kirk took the humble tomato and cheese dish and elevated it to typical JAAN standard. The many flavors are coaxed from the vine-ripened heirloom tomato- first cooked sous vide in a tomato consomm\u00e9 to intensify its flavours, then stuffed with a mixture of cubed Oxheart tomatoes, gherkins, capers and oregano. It was then restored to its original shape by the process of dehydrating and rehydrating the fruit. The supporting basil sorbet, green basil and mimolette cheese pesto, Japanese tomato berries, olive soil, burrata brought out the intense sweetness of the tomato, by providing a refreshing song in the background. This is the most sophisticated and complicated tomato I've eaten. Another gorgeous plate was the Farmer's Harvest with Hand Dived Scottish Scallop, a dish that changes with the season. A combination of sous vide and roasted, blanched, baked, pickled, pureed, grilled root and leafy seasonal vegetables provided the different textures and that Carrasco ham added a nutty salty balance for that meaty flavor. There is just so many evolving layers on 1 plate! Of course the perfectly seared scallops contribute to the meatiness of this dish. A short break later and bam. Kirk hits home with comfort and stability with the Line Caught John Dory served with crayfish tail, fava beans, broad beans, clams and pea puree. The dish is finished with a pea velout\u00e9 poured tableside. I felt stuffed but i couldn't help but finish every bit of this perfectly browned fish. This is almost an Asian dish i feel. The Roasted Venison Saddle was the most heavy handed dish of the lot but the meal peaks here. A New Zealand venison is served medium rare, with celeriac ribbons that have been blanched in wholegrain mustard emulsion, pear glazed in port sauce, pear chutney and celeriac puree. Ah such lovely Christmas flavors. I thought it was a tad salty for me though. Dessert song with a lilt. High again on the Ivory Caramel, an out of this world chocolate dessert made with 45% Michel Cluizel white chocolate, flourless chocolate sponge with tempered chocolate sheets are joined by French caramelised hazelnuts and sous vide Aero chocolate.","622":"Jaan, derived from the ancient Sanskrit word for 'bowl', is currently ranked 29th in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants. Currently lead by Chef de Cuisine Kirk Westway, Jaan offers elevated modern french cuisine with imaginative twists and beautiful aesthetics. I visited this establishment with Miss M in September 2015 as a celebration for both of our birthdays.This restaurant had been on my to-go list for a very long time. Having only 40 seats in the dining room, it was quite a challenge to get a reservation in their restaurant. During my previous visit to Singapore, I had tried calling them up to reserve a table one week in advance, but it was fully booked. So during my subsequent trip, I've made sure to e-mail them about one month in advance.Located on the 70th floor of Equinox Complex, entering the restaurant is an experience by itself. There is a booth at the ground floor that leads the way to an elevator up to the restaurant. After passing through several short hallways, we entered the restaurant and were lucky enough to be seated at a table with a spectacular view that oversees the Marina Bay Sands. The set up of the dining room felt really special with its bright, classy interior at such a high elevation. This was by far the most romantic restaurant I've ever been.Dining at Jaan was one of the best fine dining experiences I've had so far. At a very affordable price point of $118, I would say that their lunch degustation was more than worth it. However, be mindful that they have an additional charge for their amuse bouche which was automatically included in our lunch.Their stand out dishes were the heirloom tomato collection and their rosemary infused organic egg. I can't praise them enough for the creativity and artistry demonstrated in all of their dishes. All of their plates looked so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. All these factors combined, along with excellent service, lead to a very enjoyable meal.","623":"Quite simply, Jaan is one of the best fine dining restaurants in Singapore and another one of what I would expect to get the top Michelin Star marks. Writing about Jaan on here is like doing so for Andre, almost every review written is much better than what I can ever write.Nik T., Birgit W, and many others definitely do a great job putting an experience identical to my own into words. It was a very surprising and highly impressive experience...and I was there for Valentine's Day! Foodwise, it was great and again I think others do a great job in putting the menu into words. So instead I will write about my experience.I was expecting a typical boring French restaurant that you'd find in London, NYC and other cities that are pretentious and uninspiring with your traditional pigeon, foie gras, sea bass, etc but was pleasantly surprised from beginning to end where Chef Kirk Hathaway did a hell of an amazing job putting together a menu of creative and tasteful delights. Yes he did use those boring ingredients I mentioned but in a very unique way with a new flavor than that I've ever had before.The view also can't be beat and you gotta do your best to get a table with the view.Only downsides - the biggest is the wine list. It's weak and lacks a lot of depth. I hate the iPad wine list too and I hope these high end restaurants (French Laundry and Per Se included) start getting rid of it. One of the coolest and more impressive things about restaurants is if they bring out a brick of a wine list binder - everyone always goes WOW by it. Not a dirty iPad that God knows how many people touched. Also, I'm not sure if the French guy is the sommelier but he didn't do much with suggestions or even offering to pour our expensive bottle of wine into a decanter (it needed it). I hope this was a Valentine's Day thing only since it was busy, but there was no one there to pour the wine even after multiple requests (it was on a separate table since there was no room on our table) when our glasses were empty.Second is that I wish they only staff servers that know the food courses inside and out and are passionate about it. There were a few courses where the server would come out and recite what was memorized and quickly leave which was pretty annoying for a place like that, especially if I can't understand their accent.Otherwise, everything was perfect and made for one memorable Valentine's Day. The staff really was very kind and made everything that we want happen for us. The main server who was running around still was a total rockstar. One of the greatest parts was that Chef Kirk actually came out and greeted us with one of the desserts. We chatted for a good while about a number of topics. It was awesome. I hope other restaurants start adopting this personal touch.Highly recommend for that special someone or a great family dinner. Book at least a week in advance or maybe you'll get lucky if booking later and on a weekday. Totally deserves the best!","624":"What to say that has not been said before? ....great service, amazing food, and nice venue (if you get a table by the Windows--make sure to call early enough to get that!). We had the 7 course menu, with the wine pairing; if anything, the wine pairing was the only thing that left me slightly disappointed (too many whites...)As for best of Singapore... I still prefer Andre, it is more of an \"adventure \", but this is getting close!","625":"Exceptionally good. \u00a0A Michelin rated French restaurant on the 70th floor of the swisshotel. \u00a0Features a young chef who is very talented. \u00a0Arguably the best food I have ever eaten. \u00a0Go there! \u00a0And do a degustation.","626":"Where do I even start? I'm thinking of new superlatives to give this restaurant, but I will ramble anyway:First we start with the view. An absolutely tremendous view of the skyline - able to see the Singapore Flyer and the Gardens by the Bay. It is as if you are dining in a spaceship overlooking Pandora from Avatar fame.Next the service. Attentive and worthy of accolades from the Michelin Guide (once it comes to Singapore), and definitely comparable to the some of the best restaurants in New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, etc.And then the food. OH THE FOOD. Some of my most memorable food experiences have come at Marea, Lahaina Grill, Morimoto and Le Bernadin. The atmosphere, the company, the service and most importantly the food all come together to create the best possible experience. Put Jaan right up there on the list. All of the food was perfectly seasoned, cooked extremely well, and presented in a way that made you just sit and admire (before polishing the plate clean). A phenomenal experience.","627":"Jaan is constantly rated as one of the best dining experiences in Singapore and in Asia so I must admit I had some pretty high expectations when arriving on the top floor of the Swissotel where it is located. I must say that I also had some fears about how the service would be as it was an annoying experience booking with them - they required as to pre-select which menu we wanted (they offered three options: 5-Course Degustation Menu at S$198++ per person, - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a07-Course Prestige Menu at S$238++ per person and 10-Course Gastronomic Menu at S$298++ per person) as well as providing scanned copies of the credit card. To me just ridiculous to have such processes in place but anyway after some discussions with them managed to reach a solution. Our group had opted for the 7-course menu and as I am not always a fan of seafood I had asked for that to be excluded from the menu.In a sense it is a really nice location with beautiful views over Singapore but the design of the place is weird and does not at all look stylish or classy and to me at also lacks charm and warmth so would hope they redecorate. Upon arriving we were asked if we wanted a drink to start with - as is too often the case we were not presented with any menu but rather just a mention of a few of the options without any prices mentioned. Had to specifically ask to see the wine list and then saw that many of the wines had insane mark-ups even for Singaporean standards. We settled on a half-bottle of Champagne to split as we just wanted a small glass before dinner. While we were then still studying the wine list and the options the first dishes started coming in. No problem for us but when we were then ready to order wine for the meal the surprise came. One person the table wanted the wine pairing and was then told it was impossible as he had already eaten the first dish - he said it was fine Just serve that wine now and he will still drink it but the staff insisted it was not possible as it was a wine pairing. Luckily the sommelier saw that we were not really happy at this point and came over and asked if she could help and then she quickly said it is of course not a problem. Still not the type of service expected at this sort of place.The waitress we had actually was a bit off as she put out the cutlery on the table on the correct side of the plate for three of us but constantly reversed it for the fourth person at the table (the same person who she refused to let order the wine pairing). Otherwise the service was fine but at nice restaurants it is the little things that should also stand out.The food was ranging from very good to excellent but interestingly enough the replacement dishes I received not wanting fish and seafood were by far the best dishes and left the others at the table jealous. Looking at the price level of Jaan (the bill with wine, food, coffee\/tea came to around 600 SGD per person) it was not at all as good as expected and it pales in comparison with some of the other top restaurants in Asia (thinking the likes of L'effervesence, Takazawa, Narisawa, Issaya Siamese Club, Gaggan, Eat Me and Nahm) and clearly with similar restaurants in both Europe and the US so I was a but underwhelmed. I am not saying that it was bad but just not good enough and I am not even ranking this as one of the best places in Singapore so while perfectly acceptable I will not visit again as there are so many other better places.","628":"YEAH!I went here last year and tried the 5-course lunch. This was it. This became the meal that all future meals would need to live up to. If this review is still up it means that I've not had any better dining experience since (and I've tried 1300+ restaurants). I'd go back to Singapore just to eat here.The highlight of the meal was the egg on top of a bowl of rosemary smoke. The view from the building, the presentation of each course, the price (quite reasonable!), and how good it all tasted easily made this the best meal of my life.","629":"The food, the service, the wine, nothing could have been better! Pigeon meat was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing, All chef's complimentary appetizers & desert were heavenly. I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic night out, a celebration, or to experience a fabulous dinner whenever you travel to Singapore. Restaurant manager, Frank Philippe, was courteous.","630":"jaan was the birthplace of chef andre chiang in singapore.chef julien royer had big shoes to fill and i think he has done well.jaan still combines great view with great food!the price for the great view however is that it can be too glaring during lunch time.so dont forget your sunglasses!truth be told, i actually came here thinking that the 'chef with altitude 2012' event featuring david toutain of agape substance had started!needless to say i was wrong, it's from 5-10 nov.the only saving grace was that they were featuring a new autumn menu.phew.be warned, 750ml of chateldon sparkling water goes for $20!!!for more value ask for the free lemon slices:)a glass of 2010 sancerre is $26.3, 5 or 7 course menu is available for lunch at $58, $88, $138 respectively, without wine pairing.we went with the 5 course degustation lunch menu as the 7 course menu is a chef's surprise menu.the amuse bouche was really lovely!both visually and in terms of taste.smoked eel with apple jelly, crispy as can be chicken skin, deep fried cheese balls and chef julien's interpretation of humus( lentils, aubergine and chestnut paste)then came amuse bouche part deux!mushroom tea poured into a portobello mushroom sabayon.lovely complexity in texture and taste.the in house bread selection wonderfully featured a choice of black truffle brioche, mini baguette, a sour dough and\/or a walnut raisin roll.my recommendation is the divine black truffle brioche and the jaan staple walnut raisin roll.after all that feasting, 5 courses still remain! first course:'BRESSE' CHICKEN, CONFIT OXTAIL and FOIE GRAS 'PRESS\u00c9'BLACK FIGS, MAPLE REDUCTION, TOASTED PO\u00ceLANEa terrine of chicken, oxtail and foie gras.rich and hearty, balanced with the sweet figs and maple reduction.visually tantalizing too.second:55' ROSEMARY SMOKED ORGANIC EGG SMOKED RATTES, AUTUMN MUSHROOMS, CHORIZO IBERICO, BUCKWHEATonsen eggs, perfectly runny orangy yolk with soft whites.slow cooked at around 60 degrees for 55mins.chanterelle mushrooms and smoked rattes added earthiness and nutiness, buckwheat pops texturised and chorizo iberico made it savoury.lovely dry ice presentation to boot.third:CRISPY SKINNED ATLANTIC MACKEREL PICKLED SHALLOT, SQUID, SWEET CORN, JUS'DOLCE FORTE'as per menu description, crispy skin it was.fresh, juicy mackerel without being overly oily.finely sliced complimenting crispy baby squid.finished with sweet corn mash and a sweet reduction.my favourite of the lot!fourth:36 HOURS KUROBUTA PORK FORGOTTEN VEGETABLES, AUTUMN BROTHby now your stomach might be stuffed.but the pork belly was fork tender and melt in your mouth good.the very sight of which can be a nightmare for the average healthy diner!the forgotten vegetables, of which i can only remember the parsnip, helped cut through some of the greasiness.the autumn broth, which was ala tonkotsu ramen, was slurped till the very last drop.are we there yet?nope!it's pre-dessert time!a granny smith apple foam with basil granita and shiso leaves.a very good palate cleanser.fifth:CHOCONUTS 3.0 SABLE BRETON, TANARIVA CHOCOLATE, TONKA BEAN ICE CREAM, MACADAMIA & PECAN NUTS, WALNUT SNOWchocolate mousse, peanut butter, more chocolate, more nuts, more chocolate, more nuts, more chocolate!sweet, rich and decadent!done right?nope!post dessert time!!!their petits fours consists of pineapple sorbet with crackling pops, raspberry chocolate lollies, mini madeleines, nutty chocolates and pineapple jelly.and finally the latte to finish was but anti-climatic.p.s. dbs\/posb card holders are entitled to a 15% discount.","631":"most memorable was the incredible service. we were able to enjoy 5-courses in under 45 min. w\/o feeling rushed. staff was attentive to my incessant questioning about ingredients & wine. i have to admit that i wasn't blown away by the food itself, but the unique use of temperature as a focal point certainly highlighted a few dishes.","632":"Absolutely LOVED it here! \u00a0Everything from the service to the gorgeous dishes was perfection. \u00a0We had the menu epicure and we enjoyed every dish. \u00a0I would highly recommend spending more and getting this tasting so that you can try all of their best dishes. \u00a0I didn't want \u00a0the meal to end! We didn't ask for it but had a table next to the window and I definitely think it's worth requesting.","633":"I was taken to Jaan for my birthday dinner after work (back in June) and it was one of the best meals I've had in awhile. (two person course meal with wine was around $750 including tax) It's the best fine dining in Singapore and the food was up to par compared with all the top restaurants' in New York. \u00a0The restaurant is very private, with only up to six tables in the whole restaurant. it overlooks an amazing view facing the Suntec building and you'd be at awe being on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel. It was a perfect birthday dinner surprise dinner by my hubby.They're known for their pigeon meat- I tried for the first time and I'm not sure what to think of it. It's tender and tastes like chicken, but it's pigeon. My mind and palette were going at each other and my conclusion is that it was delish and at least i've tried it once in my life and not sure if I'd try again. I'm an adventurous eater but eating a pigeon was a bit too much. All other dishes were made to perfection and I loved each and every one of their 14 course meals! Hopefully I'll return again soon!","634":"Jaan is situated on the 70th floor of the Swissotel, and has a aerial view of the whole of Singapore's central district. The restaurant seats only 40 people max which means that you get a lot of personal space and dedicated service. If you are able to take your eyes away from the beautiful view out of the window, you will notice the crystals decorating the ceiling of the restaurant which gives the whole place a classy and ornate look.I went to Jaan when Chef Julien Royer was there. All the dishes were beautifully presented and the innovative and complex tastes really pushed our taste buds to the limit. The service was also impeccable. This is what fine dining should be and there is nothing more that I can ask for.They have an extremely good for value lunch menu of $58 for 3 courses or $88 for 5 courses. Dinner menus costs more and you can also order from the a la carte menu. The menu changes every season so do go to their website to download their latest menu.","635":"Amazing. Just mind-blowing. I had a fully vegan meal there and absolutely loved it! Such attention to detail, gorgeous and full of flavour with the best possible ingredients. mylifeinsin.com\/2013\/09\/\u0085","636":"Review is probably many many months late as Julien Royer is no longer working there - but his sous Kirk Westaway has taken over. Had a mix of traditional nouvelle cuisine flavours and some dishes that made me think deep about what it means when flavours are joined. The restaurant had a great view, although uncharacteristically I didn't spend too much time checking out the d\u00e9cor.","637":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but, alas, they were dashed. \u00a0The location and sights are amazing. \u00a0Several of the dishes tasted quite good. \u00a0But I think what got me was that the dishes all involved a lot of the technique of modern haute cuisine, but seemingly without any real soul. You probably ask, \"What is that supposed to mean?\" What I mean is that many of the dishes were drawn with complex and varied textures and flavors that did not merge into a coherent and meaningful whole. Consider the salad: olive oil nodules, freshly warmed berry, wilted field greens, heirloom carrot, etc. Every element was done with great detail. But in the end, it was all sorted onto the plate like a pile (well, curved like a J). \u00a0The flavors run all over each other, and there isn't a core experience of what these flavors are together supposed to create in your mouth. \u00a0Except for the amuse bouche (the mushroom tea in a bodum shot glass)--other dishes were the same. There also was no real theme to the meal that I could understand. \u00a0The beef was excellently cooked, and served with a fine risotto. \u00a0But the beef and the risotto don't seem to balance and complement each other at all. \u00a0It seemed like there was so much excellent technique, but when all was said and done the parts of the meal do not sum to anything greater than these several parts. \u00a0I had expected much better for the venue, the hype, and the price.Separately about service, we could not stomach the oysters. We even made a point to mention to the server that we thought they were bad when she asked, but she made no effort to find out what we meant or to rectify it. If I'm asked why I did not eat something, then I hope you will try to understand what I said and act on it. Otherwise, please do not ask.","638":"This is a restaurant that competes with the best in the world. Falling into a fiercely competitive Uber restaurant category that has it's mainstays with 14 course dinners, finest ingredients, best service, culinary technique and as a result high prices. The restaurants I can compare it to are Alinea and True from Chicago and although it was the most expensive dinner my wife and I have ever had it could not measure up to these giants of culinary excellence. Don't get me wrong, it's still an amazing place, so let me start with what I liked.It holds a breath-taking view at the top of the Singapore Swiss Otel. From this lofty perch it commands a view of the surrounding city as well as Marina bay. The ceiling has glass plates resembling mother of pearl giving you the impression there is a sort of origami clam shell floating above you. Both food and drinks have a wow factor. I got a sort of egg white, apricot Bellini with the most delightful hard whipped foam on top. Food taste was excellent, using the best ingredients in the most delightful combinations. Some dishes had excellent presentation namely the amuse bouche was perhaps one of the largest and best presentations I've had. It came on a mix of holders; some rock, others bamboo and had a sauce you would eat out of a stylized can.Another favorite presentation was when we received a carton of eggs opened up, with dry ice billowing a fog below it. The egg was deposited by our waiter onto the top of a delicious soup. All I've said so far is amazing so why 3 stars? Indeed it's not in the piece by piece breakdown but in the comparison to other cream of the crop restaurants that brings it down.- I think back to Alinea where I ate a fruit leather balloon or had a decadently filled Chocolate urn shattered onto my waterproof tablecloth. Those were wow moments, I never even imagined food could be served like this, Jaan did not offer surprises of this level. - Dinner prices are the equivalent of an intercontinental flight. A meal at this price is one you don't just hope to remember, you need to remember it. One way of facilitating this is through a printout you can take of the menu. I've gotten these each time, even embossed with my name on them. It's not that I'm going to frame the thing but it can certainly help me remember the experience fondly.- When the cheese tray rolled around as one of the last items I thought to myself well I'm pretty full already but heck this is probably some grade A amazing cheese and I've already paid for it. I was half right; although we had some smelly flavorful cheeses elegantly served they were not included in our chef's tasting menu. I'm a bit upset that I was served cheese costing 140 without anyone bothering to inform me it was not included; I had that expectation from other fine dining restaurants that had included it. I would have certainly denied it to fill up on more of what was to come if I had known. All in all the food was great in taste but presentation that was not up to par with other uber restaurants and not being told about the extra costs set this experience back for me.","639":"One of the best set lunches in town at this price point. None of the dishes are boring, which is more than I can say for many overpriced\/overrated fine dining establishments around. The flavours here are complex but down-to-earth, and put together with a light, deft touch.","640":"Interesting but felt chef was trying to hard. Way too complex compilation and presentation. We had 7 course dinner which was actually ten or eleven. It was just too much; it's difficult to explain. For an example, one dish had many ingredients in the bowl. It was served with an egg heated to 55 degrees for 60 minutes, and was pointed out this was an exact process. They then poured the soft egg onto other contents in bowl and stir. Guess what? \u00a0It tasted like a bowl of yolk. Which is fine but what's the point of all the other ingredients? \u00a0All were like this. The foie gras was best I ever had but all the other stuff took away from it. The pidgin Brest was the only thing I really enjoyed, cooked to perfection. It was only thing I could eat alone although it to was served with a bunch of other distracting stuff I just ignored. All in all, the complexity was a gastronomic distraction and I felt I was eating various states of stews and goulashes. A great chef should be able to produce spectacular dishes without so much variation in one serving. One dish had perfect piece of fish, served with bits of fried squid, topped with caviar, and then a bunch of odd greens and sprouts. Served as a meal with appropriate portions it could have complemented one another but to eat all that in a single bite you got none of the pleasantness of the ingredients and were just left with a mouthful of fishy mush. Well, just one persons thoughts. \u00a0 .","641":"Some of the best prawn mee soup in sg.I have been a fan of Jln Sultan hae mee soup since the 1970s!The place can be hot and stuffy though.I find it is better to go before the lunch rush as it can get crowded.This and the beach rd hae mee soup are the 2 favourite places for me to indulge in this dish!","642":"Flavour city. Sauce and soup is great, not overdone. Prawns are fresh. Noodles are done perfectly. Parking is limited. They are open until 3:30 but frequently sell out by 2:30.","643":"Love the prawn noodles here. The soup version is much better than the dry version as the prawn soup here is awesome. We like that it is not too oily and has that great seafood broth taste. Very sweet! Love the bee-hoon-mee combination.The standard combination of ngo hiang is great to go with the prawn noodles. The ngo hiang is not the best out there, but it's a great side dish to share among when you are there.Service is swift and quick. I guess the broth is all ready and just need to be poured over the noodles.Opening hours are from 8am to 3.30pm. So it can get really hot here in the mid-afternoon humidity. Ice cold barley or lime juice is great with the noodles. They are closed on tuesdays.","644":"Its very common for shops to have names when they're nowhere near the supposed location and Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee is one of them. Introduced by a friend who found out I enjoyed everything prawn related, the stall is conveniently located near Kallang MRT and is just a short 3min walk away. It gets packed during lunch really quickly so be prepared to wait or visit after the peak hours to be safe and if you don't like to wait. Service there is swift and curt, with no room for small talk. The prawns are decently large and \u00a0full of flavor and the prices are much, much cheaper compared to other more 'famous' places.","645":"The best hawker stall food in my entire trip is here at Jian Bo Shui Kueh. It's located to the left corner immediately as you enter the 2nd floor of Tiong Bahru. You can't miss it since there always seems to be a line there.The shui kueh doesn't look like much at first. It's just steamed rice cake topped with a pile of radish with seasoning. However, the topping is amazingly delicious. In fact, it was one of the only food I finished on the entire trip and went back for another order.Plenty of people also stop by to get it to go. I was tempted to take a 3rd order with me but had to refrain. If I'm ever in Singapore again, I would definitely be back to eat this.","646":"I already had so much food but I couldn't leave Tiong Bahru without having tasted some shui kueh, which apparently here, is the best you can get in Singapore. And who told me that wasn't wrong: this has been by far, the best shui kueh (\"water cake\") I ever tried here in town. The history of Jian Bo Shui Kueh located in Tiong Bahru hawker centre apparently goes as far back as 1960. The shui kueh is topped with \"chye pooh\" (preserved radish) that is sweet and nutty at the same time. The cake results to be soft and smooth, and is well complemented with the chilli that doesn't overpower the whole taste, working very well with the salty and browned chye poh. A unique delicacy!","647":"Yeap this shui kueh is nice. Probably one of the best shui kueh, translate as Water Cakes, you can find in Singapore.The shui kueh is steamed rice flour and steamed in a small cup. The texture of the steamed rice cake is smooth and light. Topped over it is Chye Poh condiments, and this is the best part of the dish. This shop's chye poh differ from the rest in that you can taste the dried shrimp in it. The others does not add this stuff. That the main difference here.However, this condiment is too oily. You can see the excessive oil dripping down the shui kush and the pool of oil when you are done with it. Otherwise the review would been 5 stars.","648":"I hunted this place down due to the reviews. \u00a0I didn't realize it was in a hawker market upstairs. \u00a0What a neat place. \u00a0All kinds of different food vendors. \u00a0All the food is extremely cheap and so far delicious. \u00a0This place is no exception. \u00a0The main dish (shui kueh) is delicious and a must try!!!","649":"This Shui Kueh is pretty good, and affordable too.The kueh in itself is pretty average; however, those vegetables that come with the kueh is unbelieavably tasty. It has this sweetness to it, a little bit of sourness and is crunchy. Worth a try.","650":"There is, in my mind, no better Chwee Kueh than Jian Bo's. \u00a0 Chwee Kueh is a humble dish that given time and evolving tastes may fade from the Singaporean culinary scene and from the face of the earth. \u00a0Panic set in yet? \u00a0If you are the foodie that you say you are, your pulse should be racing and the vein in your temple pulsing right about now. \u00a0 \u00a0Well, ok, I may be overstating the case somewhat, and if the lines in front of Jian Bo are any indication, then Chwee Kueh is safe for now.Chwee Kueh is cakes made from rice flour and then steamed to creamy semi-firmness. \u00a0This simple cake is traditionally accompanied by two condiments, \"chye poh\" and a savory chili paste. \u00a0\"Chye poh\" is a salty, buttery, umami-laden concoction that has wondrous and magical powers on the human palate. \"Chye poh\" which actually refers specifically to one of the main ingredients of this condiment, preserved diced Chinese radish. \u00a0Although technically a condiment, the \"chye poh\" is in my humble opinion, the star. \u00a0Chwee Kueh lives or dies on the quality of the \"chye poh\". \u00a0Jian Bo's version is outstanding! \u00a0The diced preserved radish is stir-fried with sesame seeds and I suspect in sesame oil. \u00a0This elevates the two-dimensional saltiness of the pickled vegetable, giving it all kinds of interesting new flavor profiles with nutty, toasty and buttery notes. \u00a0Absolute genius. \u00a0I'm not the only one who thinks so, customers typically request extra servings of the condiment. The fine folks at Jian Bo are more than happy to accommodate cravings for their famous condiment. \u00a0At $3 for a small container, you'd be hurting from the gouging if this wasn't just simply phenomenal! \u00a0I usually just pony up because the \"chye poh\" will also elevate another quotidian standard, \"chye poh neng\" or \"chye poh\" omelette, although frittata is more technically appropriate. \u00a0The \"chili\" or \"hot sauce\" is the spice that wakes up the palate. \u00a0This is also good, but a certainly less famous member of the entourage, just like Johnny Drama, full of wannabe angst, with anger management issues. It's dried chilies stir-fried with dried shrimps...what's not to like?? \u00a0The ratios of condiments with each cake are hotly debated and a matter of personal preference and orientation. \u00a0At the end of the day, you find what you like, make your peace and keep your mouth shut about whether you think this is better than your cousin's mix. \u00a0It's not as contentious as Jameson versus Bushmills, but it's pretty close.At the end of the day, it's all about visiting a Singapore landmark, Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre, ordering up 10 of these lovely creamy rice cakes for less than $4 (at the time of this writing), and enjoying each cake doused with a heaping helping of the aforementioned \"condiments\" and letting the lied of legacy flavors play soothingly in your head. \u00a0And may I make so bold as to suggest an intermission of a sip of local milk tea and then letting that music continue to play to an audience of one.Of course, there's also Hai San and Tiong Bahru Fried Kway Teow in the house, so remember to leave enough room for a whole orchestra of flavors to flood your head.","651":"The best chye poh and the rice kueh is super soft and moist. Absolutely the best chwee kuey in Singapore","652":"Can't believe there are only two reviews for this wonderful little spot of Heaven! When I moved to Singapore from America when I was a kid, my parents used to bring me to Tiong Bahru Market every weekend to wean me off cereal and toast. We would troop down to the then single storey market and brave the long lines for this little piece of goodness.18 years on, I no longer live in Singapore. But every time I touch down on the sunny island, this would be the first place I would go. Jian Bo Chwee Kueh, you have my heart. Now, and forever.","653":"As a commoner cheap food(though not a Michelin starred), \u00a0this is definitely best in sg and probably in the world! w strong ?? (fried dried shimplets)?and not just cheap chaipo (pickled chopped radish ??) to make it saltyIt could easily go above 4.5star!Photos: ieatishootipost.sg\/jian-\u0085","654":"The best there is, all other chwee kueh (little steamed cup-shaped rice cakes) hope to be it.Chwee kueh is cheap, comfort food for many. Served with finely diced cai pok (preserved radish) and satisfyingly spicy chilli, this was one of the only foods my grandmother would indulge in without any inhibition, and she was very picky about her food especially when cancer robbed her of her appetite.But when I bought her Jian bo chwee kueh and ate with her in front of the TV, it was one of our happier moments when I realised I finally found something delicious enough to make her feel like eating again.Jian bo chwee kueh stands out, not only because of its fast factory-precision serving line that Ford would be proud of, so long lines move quickly and everyone has a chance at getting their guilty pleasure for only $1.20 (4 pieces). The rice cakes are soft and moist, and the cai pok is fragrant, fried with sesame and dried shrimps. It has all the right bits for perfection.I never eat chwee kueh from any other stalls since I found Jian bo, because that would be like cheating, with an uglier person.","655":"At 4 for $1.40, it is slightly more expensive than the Bedok Chwee Kueh (4for$1) but we do not mind because the chye poh here is EXCELLENT. You can notice that extra nutty aroma and crunchy texture because it is stir fried with sesame seeds. As the owners continue to mill their own rice flour for the chwee Kuey, each petite rice cake is soft to each bite.The best chwee kueh tasted so far","656":"I followed the Yelp recommendations to this little hole-in-the-wall. I'm a white boy from Sydney so the food court felt quite exotic to me. I ate eight of these little fellas, with some of the chilli paste. Delicious and worth the very little money I paid for them, but they are an appetiser, not a full meal. The lady who served me was delightful and I ordered a lemon and plum juice from next door. Definitely a million times better than anything on the tourist strip outside.","657":"Tiong Bahru market is well known for it's wonderful hawker food. It's best to avoid this place on Sunday mornings, people from all over the country flock here to have Sunday lunch and as a result, queues are long and seating is sparse. Chwee Kway is a popular local breakfast staple and this particular stall serves the best version of it. This stall has been around for a long time, I remember visting this stall at the old tiong bahru market when I was a child. It was already very popular since then! The dish is basically rice cakes served with Chai po (turnip meticulously chopped, prepared and fried), and eaten with chilli on the side. It's served on a brown paper (very old school). There's more than one stall in Tiong bahru market that serves this dish so be sure to check the unit number! When enjoying your food in Tiong Bahru market area, you'd be well advised to park legally, many people get tickets in this area.","658":"Sunday brunch at Jiang Nan Chun is phenomenal. From the succulent roasted meats, to the exquisite soups and the well-executed mains, just about every dish on the fairly extensive ala carte buffet menu was flawless. Not one bad dish. So even if we had to waddle out of the restaurant, Jiang Nan Chun is definitely on my to-return list!Apart from Cherry Garden, this is the only other place I'd ever advise anyone to visit for such ala carte buffet brunches.Service was as of you'd expect of a Four Seasons, attentive but unintrusive, efficient and slick but warm and gracious.","659":"Excellent menu and great service. So good I went twice.(A special mention to Dolly)So when in Singapore do yourself a favour.#facxual_events","660":"After Dreams of the Red Chambers and Legend of the West, Four Seasons Jiang Nan Chun introduces their Literature series once again and the theme is none other than \"Four Great Beauties of China\". Not only will you be mesmerized by the exceeded beauty of the dishes, one will be dazzled by the narration that reveals the other side of these legendary personalities. Why does Yang Gui Fei love soaking in fragrant baths and how can the fishes be so amazed by beauty of Xishi that they forgot to swim and drowned to their blissful death? The 5-course menu is really worth trying and I highly recommend you to do so before it ends on 31st Jan :)","661":"Cuppage Plaza is known for the small Japanese restaurants that cater to the discerning palates of the Japanese community in Singapore. As seedy as it may be, with Thai and Vietnamese call girls loitering on the corridors, once you step into the individual restaurants, you'd think that you're in Japan. That's exactly my thoughts after stepping into the super discreet (no sign board) and high security (you need to buzz the intercom before you're allowed in) Kappo Shunsui.Those familiar to the Tokyo food scene may have heard of Shunsui, which was named in Michelin Guide's Bib Gourmand list for three consecutive years between 2015 and 2017. And now, the man behind the same restaurant, Chef Tomo Watanabe, has set up shop here in Singapore.Kappo Shunsui serves a Kappo-style cuisine which is all about creating balance throughout the course \u00a0of a meal by the use of five primary cooking techniques: grilling, steaming, frying, simmering and raw preparation. From behind the counter, Chef Watanabe prepares and cooks for the lucky 19 who get a taste of the ever changing seasonal menu made with produce delivered from Tsukiji Market thrice weekly and other imported Japanese ingredients.A qualified kikisake-shi (sake sommelier), Chef Watanabe has also curated an impressive list of close to 100 labels of sake, including bottles not listed on the menu, from his private collection. These are available by the glass and bottle (From $12\/63 respectively). Sake pairing for the omakase is also available ($55\/85 for 6 glasses of 60ml).I quite enjoyed this very special malty sake with some shoyu scent to it. Aside from sake, other wines and spirits like whisky, shochu and champagne are also available. Omakase is served for dinner, and a la carte options are only available from 9pm onwards. For this season, we had the Zuwai Crab and Uni with Tosazu Jelly to start. The light sweetness of the produce, including the lovely Shizuoka Amela tomato, is complemented by the equally refreshing dashi jelly made with Chef's own dashi stock.The Hamaguri Shinjo warm soup features a clean and elegant dashi with a cloud like fish cake and Chiba clams. The briny savoriness and sweetness of the shell fish, as well as the smoky bonito and dried tuna, conjured the flavors of the sea in our mouths. Lovely.We quickly moved on to the sashimi course of Toro, Botan Ebi, Aori Ika. Just look at that clear red in tuna belly!I was blown away by the glorious Maguro Zuke, which has been soy marinated before being served. Pops of umami, with perfectly cooked and flavored rice. Just bring me all the sushi already!I noted the edo-mae style of preserving fish at Kappo Shunsui. Here's chef with his kelp grouper from Nagasaki, which has been cured in house for about 2 weeks.The firm fish went into the Kue Nabe, a simple but delicious pot of fish with lettuce, leek, and spring onion. Pick up the ingredients and give them a wash in the ponzu and grated radish mix before taking a bite. We sure could eat this all night. A clean sake to go with the nabe! How about an Oita Chawanmushi with Hokkaido uni and Italian truffle caviar? I was a little let down by the ammonia taste of the uni, as i was expecting pure sweetness. Hmm..A grated pear puree with some young yuzu skin to cleanse our palate for the mains.The A4 Omi Gyu Sirloin Roast Beef from Shiga is another highlight of the meal! The beef is marinated in dashi, roasted, and then slow cooked for that lovely tenderness. This is paired with some grilled turnip and a sweet spring fresh onion puree. How about just serving me a slab of this? The final course is always rice and Chef serves his signature claypot rice (which remains constant on his seasonal menu). On his current Spring menu is Red Snapper Claypot Rice served with Red Miso and Shijimi Clam Soup. To make this dish, the rice is first cooked in a clay pot with dashi before Chef Watanabe grills the red snapper over binchotan (white charcoal) until it is 80 percent cooked. The fish is then laid on top of the cooked rice to finish cooking in its gentle residual heat. Chef Watanabe uses a special blend of koshihikari and sasanishiki rice, which provides a lovely, mild stickiness and just the right firmness in the grains. The dashi gives the rice a lovely smoky bonito flavor and i especially love the light spice from the pickled ginger. Sweet (and salty) endings with Azuki Monaka and Warabi Mochi! I love the hint of salt in the red bean paste and how impossibly fluid the mochi was. The mochi is made from the Kyoto Hon Warabi Powder without any other additives. I've never had such a good one in Singapore honestly.","662":"I've been blessed to have found this gem. Situated in a cosy corner of Tiong Bahru hawker centre, the stall serves only pig organ soup. The soup is the soul of this dish. It is freshly brewed daily from pig bones and mustard vegetables; the soup has the natural tastiness of the bones and a tinge of saltiness from the mustard vegetables. Soup is clear and every sip was a immense pleasure to taste.This is by far the best pig organ soup which I have ever tasted since I've been travelling. A must try.","663":"I remember melting under the sweltering sun and queuing for what I consider the best pig's organ soup in Singapore when I was younger. Back in the 80s, my mum went regularly to the old Tiong Bahru Market to buy our weekly groceries. And whenever I accompanied her, I would definitely buy this for lunch.Tiong Bahru market today is a large modern complex completed in May 2006. It has a wet market and shops on the ground floor and the well-ventilated, high ceiling food centre on the second floor. A convenient open-roof carpark sits on the third floor. It replaced the old market which was the first modern market built in a housing area in Singapore. Back then it was also known as Seng Poh Market.Anyway, I disgress. I am glad the standard of my favourite pig's organ soup is still very high. Unlike the typical super peppery or super salty soup found elsewhere, Koh Brother strikes a perfect balance. Just the right amount of pepper, salted veggies that are crunchy and not too salty. Most important, the soup is clear and sweet while the ingredients are super fresh and clean. They also serve glutinous rice intestines which is hard to find these days. All of which, accompanied with their chilli and sweet black sauce, is heavenly.","664":"Labyrinth provides what you would expect of a single Michelin star restaurant. A pleasant mix of dishes - some will blow you away (the starter snacks, chilli crab ice cream and short rib were phenomenal) with their flavour and imagination. Others are just delicious (the uni, dumpling and snow.) Coming out at $230sgd for the uni, two cocktails and a third of a bottle of wine, which seemed fairly reasonable. I am glad I went - but also not desperate to return.","665":"Not worth the money. The concept is not original and their bag of tricks does not make up for the lack of flavor and miniature portions.","666":"2017 Michelin Stars: 1Staff and service was fine, food was above average. I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could, but will err on the side of generosity in this case. The place is hard to find; once you're in the area the center doesn't seem to list it in obvious places so good luck. From memory, it's on the second floor, near some escalators that are by an entrance that is away from the center 'stage' (?).","667":"The restaurant was located at the space formerly occupied by Space by TungLok. The place was decorated in all blacks. Besides offering lunch set and dinner sets, the restaurant also offered pre-theatre dinner set ($48++) on thursday to saturday at 6pm.TINGKATradish cake, rojak, nasi lemakThe radish cake was in a cylinder cone with a stick in the centre. Tasted not bad although felt it was a tab plain and wished one could taste shredded radish and dried shrimp in it. The crispy square puff was packed with rojak sauce in it. Interesting pack of flavours. The coconut flavoured chwee kueh was topped with sambal, and reminded one of nasi lemak.HIROSHIMA OYSTERlaksaThe noodle was created with coconut milk and a fat juicy hiroshima oyster was used to replace cockles which was usually found in laksa. The floss was spicy with flavours of laksa.DUCKbraised duck dumplingThe dumplings were served in a bamboo basket with soup in a glass bowl. The dumplings were covered in a transparent skin made of sweet potato. Somehow felt that the filling was over flavoured and covered the duck's flavour.TIGER PRAWN ($10 SUPPLEMENT) pen cai risottoThe fa cai had a light and crispy texture. The risotto was well flavoured with oyster sauce, shiitake mushrooms , beancurd skin, and dried shrimps .XIAO LONG BAO chendolA greenish xiao long bao served in a bamboo basket with gula melaka syrup in a small jar. The green skin was made to represent the green jelly strips usually found in chendol. The xiao long bao was packed with jelly cubes and red bean. Interesting pack of flavours when ate it in one mouthful.CIGARreese's peanut butter chocolateThe cigar was a chocolate bar with chocolate creme in it, dusted with cocoa powder, with the bottom part dusted with liquid nitrogen to make look like burn part. It was served in a glass ashtray with peanut crumbles as the burnt ashes. It was accompanied with a glass of earl grey tea with a ball of ice to look like a glass of Cognac. The rich chocolate stick was balanced by the light floral tea.PETIT FOURIt was Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter macaron. It was light and not too sweet.I washed down the meal with a glass of Lychee Martinis ($12++)Vodka, Lychee Liqueur, Lychee Extract which came with 2 pieces of canned lychee and tasted quite sweet.","668":"Let me start by saying the food we had was great - very innovative take on Singapore Street Food. There was only one \"Amuse Bouche\" item (a puff filled with fermented shrimp) which I wasn't a big fan of. The rest was great - especially enjoyed a crab dish which included crab ice spicy cream. There is a Prix Fixe Menu so no choices other than they will upsell you on Wagyu Beef instead of the regular beef and a better shrimp for one of the seafood dishes... I found the upsale thing a bit awkward as they actually come to your table with a slab of Wagyu and some big shrimp and try to convince you to pay the extra amount to improve your dinner... strange approach for a Michelin Starred Fixed Price Menu.The issue I had with the restaurant was mainly the service. We waited a bit before finally asking if we could order a cocktail - our waiter seemed confused about our order (a gin martini and an old fashioned...not very difficult). It was our last night in Singapore and we were looking to get the whole experience starting with drinks...getting some wine with dinner etc. Before our drinks came we were served the Amuse Bouche course...then quickly after that our first course came out....I then asked the waiter if our drinks would be coming out soon...since usually we would have preferred them BEFORE dinner...again the waiter looked confused then asked us again what drinks we had ordered, a little later he returned and said 5 more minutes. By the time we received our drinks the third course was arriving and of course we never got a chance to order wine...Our waiter was friendly but the elaborate explanations of the food was lost on his poor pronunciations. We didn't understand anything he was saying....which was unfortunate as the dishes were remarkably intricate. \u00a0After dinner we were not offered coffee or tea...I guess for the money I would never return or recommend to anyone but it's a shame because the food was really interesting.","669":"6 COURSES DISCOVERY MENU AMUSE BOUCHEWe started with the Street Snacks of Radish Cake, Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter, Rojak and very smooth Nasi Lemak that was served in the Rantang or metal food carrier.I really like the smooth Nasi Lemak that was served like Chwee Kueh with sambal and anchovies as toppings. The savoury radish cake had a crispy edge and was very fragrant, it looked just like a toasty marshmallow. The next Amuse Bouche that we had was the most beautiful keropok \/ prawn crackers that was injected with squid ink. This keropok was topped with mayo chili and beautiful orange fish roe and edible flower petal. BAK CHOR MEEBak Chor Mee is a popular local dishes and I usually love the distinct flavour of the chili and sourness that comes from vinegar. The Neo-Sin's version was noodle created from the squid skin served together with anchovies in the shape of minced meat and Hokkaido Scallop that looks like a fish cake. It was a miniature version of Bak Chor Mee that you could find in the local street market. You need to mix everything together to get the best flavour. This cute looking Bak Chor Mee was served on a small bowl with rooster on it, a popular bowl that brought out nostalgic feelings of eating street food during my childhood period.HAINANESE CURRY RICEThe miniature forest with bird ness and quail egg looked very magical when the staff served it in front of me. The green moss looked very delicate and who could guess that it was made from coriander. The white clay that covered the potato was imported from Spain, the 'black rock' minced chicken was very delicious and everything was put on the bed of quinoa curry. Again, it's very important to mix in all the elements to gain the true flavour. This was simply my favourite dish of the night, in terms of look as well as the strong spicy flavour that it gave. SINGAPORE CHILI CRABThis was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it. The chili ice cream was delicious, even when eaten by itself! It was moreover really delicious when mixed together with the soft shell crab. Presentation of each dish really mattered and it showed from the choice of plates that the restaurant used. This dish was presented on a light blue plate that resembled the sea, covered with mantou sand, some caviar, seaweed and foamy crab bisque.SATAY BEEFHubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the '80g' next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big. The Wagyu Ribeye was cooked medium rare, served with gnocchi (onion), satay espuma and rice cakes. The rice cakes in this case was peanut mocha which was skilfully wrapped in banana leaves. The beef was perfectly cooked and with the exact amount of layered fat to make it so enjoyable.XO FISHThe fish of the day was red garoupa with a hidden lobster claw served in the Teochew broth. This dish really reminded me of seafood gumbo although not as thick and heavy. The broth was quite light, filled with seafood flavour and mushroom. I found it best when I mixed the broth with the cooked tomato that was provided so it gave the tangy fresh flavour onto the mix.NEW ITEM: MINI APPLE TOFFEEChef Han came out from his kitchen and said hi to us. Not only that, he also brought out a surprising new item that will only be released in early April. It deceivingly looked like a mini apple toffee.PINAPPLE SORBETOur palate cleanser was a refreshing house-made pinapple sorbet and I joked to the staff that one spoon wasn't enough to clean our palate (hahaha). CHENDOL Xiao Long Bao (XLB)I want more of the Chendol XLB, it was a good start to dessert and the staff was so nice that she helped me take a pour shot by pouring the gula melaka slowly on top of the XLB. For a small item, it was quite rich since it has all the elements of chendol such as red bean, shaved ice and jellies.REESE'S CHOCOLATEThe staff playfully asked whether we smoke or drink before he carried out two ashtray filled with a cigar on each. On the other hand, he gave us a glass of Cognac. It was a peanut butter covered with dark chocolate and the Cognac was the refreshing Earl Grey tea.Now the question on people's mind will usually be 'is it worth the money that I paid for'. For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish.I had a very enjoyable night at Restaurant Labyrinth and so excited that they will add some new menu items soon. I went to the kitchen to thank Chef Han for his delicious food and to tell him that he needs to do a pop up dining in Perth... or I should just visit Singapore again.","670":"In full transparency, I have not been to this location, but I have had the pleasure of dining from a menu prepared by Chef Han at an offsite location. I was impressed by the simplicity of the dishes and the amazing flavors that were achieved by combining different ingredients together. I never imaged that a sweet oyster sauce could go so well with fillet steak. My mind was blown!Chef Han's attention to detail and knowledge of the ingredients he uses in his dishes is unmatched. The combination of flavors and tastes create a unique experience that is authentically Singaporean, rather than a so-called fusion of other cuisines. I'm am excited to follow Chef Han as he takes on his next challenge of sourcing his ingredients locally and re-creating an authentic Singaporean fine dining experience, like no other Singaporean chef has done in the past.","671":"Very friendly staff and very informative about the dish that we were going to eat. It's a great fine dining restaurant to have an intimate date.The food that Chef Han prepared was very creative, well presented and delicious. As for the price, it can be a bit pricey but all the staff here will look after you.","672":"Gastro place, the tasting menu was excellent. \u00a0Service was superb as they adjusted for the no pork, no beef requirement for me. \u00a0It's a different take to the excellent Singaporean street food. Presentation was excellent and some of the plates were very innovative and good. Worth an experience.","673":"This is one of our favorite places to come as a family. We make it a point to come back - at least once, but usually more - every single time we travel to Singapore. The food is delicious, the staff couldn't be friendlier, and my girls love the barefoot dining upstairs. If you are in Singapore, find a reason to visit this place. I can't wait until we travel back.","674":"What a treat it was to find this place. Seriously the best Indian food I've ever had and not just in Singapore. Nothing was oily, everything had discernible flavors and the staff was super nice and friendly. I can not recommend this place more. So glad we gave them a try and can't wait to go back. They also have toddler friendly dishes that have absolutely no spice. This was awesome for us because all of the other places would say no spice but would still be too hot for our girl. Plus it's fun for the whole family to sit barefoot on the floor while dining. Give it a try!","675":"I came here to eat with my cousin after reading travel advisor. \u00a0This place is located in Little India. \u00a0Kind of like a whole in the wall. \u00a0Regular price point for a whole in the wall place would be around $10.00 or at most $15.00. \u00a0I ordered the lunch for 2 which included a few pieces of fish, \u00a02 pieces of tandoori chicken, 5 pieces of fried chicken 2 shrimps, little tub full of white rice and spiced rice. \u00a0I also ordered 2 mango drinks. \u00a0My bill came out to $120. \u00a0Mind you the portions were very small as you can see from all the other yelpers pictures. \u00a0 \u00a0Taste: \u00a0It was okay, nothing too spicy like I am use to having in the U.S where the Indian mild is just off the charts. \u00a0If you are sensitive to hot foods this place is not so hot that it will leave you sweating like a pig. \u00a0Service: \u00a0In Singapore they speak very good english so he was very accommodating and nice.Overall, I had no problem with the food except for the price point. \u00a0It is way to expensive for little pieces of chicken and fish. \u00a0I can get a lot more for $120.","676":"What. A. Treat. After a hot day walking around Singapore, a cold beer and tasty butter chicken made me so happy! I went wimpy of the spice level but it suited me fine. Service was delightful. Open air table made for great people watching.","677":"Are you kidding me! This place is GREAT! I was shocked that Lagnaa didn't have 5 stars, then I read the negative and understood it was centered around price and perceived service. I'm here to tell you that its worth every cent and the service is spectacular and personalized. If you have a bad attitude or need your ass kissed, then go somewhere else, If you like friendly people who know how to make Indian food????? COME HERE.If you want very thoughtfully prepared Indian Cuisine that ranges from traditional to neuvo, then come to barefoot. I'm personally a fan of the open air simple feel, so downstairs is cool, but they also have lovely accommodations upstairs for fine evening dining. MAKE RESERVATIONS!The owner\/chef is famous in Singapore for his creations which range in HEAT from mild to \"you cant handle it\"LOVE THIS PLACE and I'll be back.","678":"Although the place has several classic tourist-trap elements (the witty menu, the wall for tourists to sign, the spice challenges), I must say the food is very good. As a fresh expat in Singapore, I felt truly welcomed in this place's friendly environment. I had a very good threadfin fish curry, just spicy enough. I'm by no means an expert on Indian food, but I'm sure what I had was much closer to proper Indian food than what I've had in other countries. At worst, Lagnaa Barefoot Dining is a very good introduction to the marvels of Indian food.You should consider that nothing is complimentary, not even the pappadams. The good thing is the staff lets you know the price of anything before you order, so, no surprises.","679":"Lots of heat, not much on flavor and definitely overpriced. It's no accident this place was empty on a Saturday night compared to other restaurants in the area. Extremely small portions. Definitely not coming back. DEFINITELY.","680":"What an interesting place. Definitely geared up for tourists, the staff are savvy, very friendly and welcoming but definitely know that they are there to generate business.That said, we got chatting and they let me diabetic friend try a vegetable they said would help naturally, and we got a little free dessert each (a little like mochi) as it was an Indian holiday.On to the food then, once you've chosen from the hilarious menu - I plumped for prawn masala - you get to choose the 'heat'. I wasn't sure so played it safe with a '2' (10 is the hottest) and by god a 2 was hot enough for me!! Be warned!It was tasty though, and not so hot the flavour was lost. We shared a couple of naan and some rice between us and overall it was pretty good food, not the biggest portions mind you but that was fine given the heat of the food and the temperature outside.Not the cheapest place, but the service helps soften the blow of the bill. We did feel a little bit crammed in though, as it's not the biggest so bear that in mind if there are more than four of you eating.","681":"One of the worse experiences I have ever had here. I waited patiently by the please wait here to be seated. The proprietor ignored me waiting and promptly set a table for a couple that arrived after me. I assume that the profit was higher for them that way. Shame I was testing the place out for a group of 8 there loss! Rude was the reply when I questioned her action. I would give ZERO STARS if I could.","682":"This restaurant had it all:1. Bad service, bad attitude, no attention paid to customers needs. We sat there waiting for the waiter to get our bill for 45 mins, he never bothered to come back once the food was sent 2. Over priced menu items for the amount of food you get! Never ever have I paid $ 15-20 for 2-3 pieces of meat in a small bowl of curry3. Mediocre food: chicken curry was the only decent dish - the spice level was inconsistent throughout each dish we got. We got level 4, but the prawn masala was more like 7-8 and was inedible quite frankly 4. Water is a self serviced item- funny enough you have to fetch water from the \"pantry\" which is also marked as a washroom. This was really odd to all of us. 5. The hostess or the owner kept trying to sell us more pappadoms for $15 - with 3 chutneys. I have never paid this much money for any pappadoms! 6. This is completely a tourist trap I usually don't write bad reviews for any restos, but this one truly disappointed us.","683":"Two stars because the food itself was actually pretty good and, on principle, I don't want to give one star to a restaurant that has decent food. Also, the menu is witty. However, this restaurant is such a tourist trap and should totally be skipped! This restaurant engages in two distinct practices that triggered tourist trap warning bells in my head from the moment I sat down (a sensation that I found negatively detracted from my dining experience):1. There is definite baiting to get you to spend on add-ons. First, the waiter refused to give us the menu until we placed a drink order. Second, the poppadom that is put on your table is an extra charge. Sketchy sketchy! 2. It is really really challenging to figure out how much your meal will be based on reading the menus. The curries themselves are small portions but priced between $15-$20. This would be fine except that drinks, rice, naan, and whatever else you want are all additional add on! By the time you order all of your sides, you've tacked on an additional $5-$10. But wait, there is more! In order to calculate your full bill, be sure to include the $1.50 poppadom and 10% service charge....honestly, it's enough to make your head dizzy. As for the food\/experience, there are so many more authentic Indian restaurants in the area that will charge you more reasonable prices (I have never even paid HALF of what I paid at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining). If you are too picky to try some of the more authentic local offerings and are blessed with a blind eye towards price, then this is certainly a place for you to go \"test your spice tolerance!!!\". However, if you just care about having an authentic experiences in Singapore, do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant!I am really disappointed that such publications as The Washington Post and Lonely Planet so highly recommend this location. My meal at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining was certainly one of those experiences that reminded me to always read travel guides with a critical eye.","684":"Frankly I would give this 1 star if it wasn't for the pictures of samosas on here, which look good.We got the bucket of strong beers. Two of them had names which reminded me of household cleaning supplies (e.g. Vorion 6000) and the third was called Knock Out. Whatever one I tried was way too sweet and didn't taste good and I left most of it on the table. I also ordered a chocolate ice cream, which they forgot to serve us, then when I mentioned this and asked for it in a take away container as we were leaving, they instead refunded me the $4. I think they were disappointed I didn't spring for the $15 dessert made of sponges of dried milk flakes.","685":"This was my favorite meal during my Southeast Asia trip. The rice was delicious with great texture. The fish curry was so delightful. The chef adapted it to be dairy free for us. The mango juice was extra refreshing in the heat. To top off the tasty meal the service was perfect. What welcoming and pleasant people.","686":"a gimmicky, very-expensive indian restaurant in little india - not the traditional indian foodery as you'd expect in this neighborhood. it seems catered toward tourists, tripadvisor (on which it has a fantastic rating) and unknowing diners a like - the gimmick of barefoot dining and variable heat levels (and of course that means there's a barely-human level up there) saying possibly everything you need to know.but I'm cynical.we started with some delicate chickpea fritters dotted with peas - I didn't think they would be, but these browned small things had loosely-bound chickpea meal and bits of peas strewn throughout. pretty delicious.for mains, we had a round of different curries and stew-like things of varying heat - and let me tell you that the third heat level pretty much packs a punch. I also can't name all of what we were eating as they were just rather spicy, spice-y things that tasted decent (but how could it not, with that many aromatics) but a spicy chickpea curry had tender legumes and the raita was cool and delicious.I don't remember anything fantastic about the chicken tikka - and I think it pretty pricey, so I would stick to the curries. get some naan to go with too, as they were delicious (and so was my roti).in any case, the food was decent. I have no qualms except that it was more expensive than expected (and warranted), and it may not be the sort of thing you expected in little india. decent otherwise, and maybe a good place for out-of-towners.","687":"Brought my kids for lunch at Lagnaa on Sunday after church. It was pouring and parking was as bad as it gets in Little India. ...but we persevered and fimally reached Lagnaa Barefoot Dining. The ambience was magnificent so was the food. Loved all the curry dishes and the naans. It helped that the manager(owner?) came to explain to us the menu and made some good recommendations. Overall, it was a very fulfilling meal for all of us. Will be coming again.","688":"This is a review of a dinner with a friend at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining. \u00a0This restaurant was one of my first restaurants on my Singapore dining wish-list. \u00a0Before I had even moved to Singapore, I had be told about it.We chose to sit downstairs. \u00a0So, we did not actually have the barefoot dining experience.What you do get seating downstairs is the feeling that you are being cooked for in someone's home. \u00a0The staff is so friendly.Plus, from my seat, I could see K7 (the chef - and no before this dining experience - i did not know him) cooking in the kitchen. \u00a0I witnessed an outpouring of love for creating amazing food. \u00a0He was also quite the gracious host. \u00a0The hostess was also extremely friendly and treated us as if we were long lost friends.I could laboriously work through detailing all of the food. \u00a0But, for this one, I am mainly going to sum it up. \u00a0It ranged from very good to excellent. \u00a0We did not really challenge the heat scale. \u00a0My dining companion for the evening does not really enjoy extremely spicy foods. \u00a0So, with her in mind, we kept two dishes at level 1 and, for me to sample, we had one dish at level 3.I found the dishes all to be wonderfully prepared. \u00a0I did not find the level 3 to be very intimidating. \u00a0On my next visit, I will work in a level 4 dish and see how I manage with that.Wheel of delicious food:tinyurl.com\/bm5bbd4My plate:tinyurl.com\/c88wmbgI will say that I did truly enjoy the vegetable pakoras; mmm, yummy crispy goodness.tinyurl.com\/c9cmzs8The garlic naan was also a home-run. \u00a0It was so fresh. \u00a0It did not have even a touch of that rubberiness than can sneak in and ruin a naan. \u00a0The garlic flavor was just right. \u00a0It was distinct without being overpowering.tinyurl.com\/bvfwhboOverall, the food was very-very good. \u00a0But, for me, what made the dining experience truly five star was the warmth of the staff. \u00a0I will certainly return.","689":"Tiny fun-sized portions. Mediocre taste. Poor inattentive service. Inflated and overpriced, even by Singapore standards. What more can I say about this terrible place? I was taken there by a friend. The portions were so small that they were able to place all five dishes (of mostly vegetables and just one meat) we ordered onto a gimmicky single round plate no larger than a single serving plate you use in buffets (meant to be shared among four people mind you). Even though the dishes had to be shared, the owner and waitress did not offer serving spoons to us. The taste was extremely mediocre. I've had much better Indian food in the US (Midwest) and Australia (Perth). They didn't even have fragrant basmati rice. Their rice tasted like overnight bad bran. I spent the same amount at two proper Indian restaurants in the same area where I had great tasting dishes of fish, chicken, and seafood (at those other restaurants, not here). It was one of the worst meals I have ever had in Singapore. When I was there, I wondered how the place even survives in Singapore and then I took a look around and knew why. Most of the diners were westerners, which is the only reason this rip-off place has repeat customers, because the only way such a place can maintain a following is by hoodwinking people who are new in town and who fall prey for mindless gimmicks like \"dining-barefoot\" easily. You can also tell from the reviewers in this website that most of the diners (and people who view the place favorably) are westerners who had just moved in to town and obviously are primed for being \"chopped\". This place would close down in a week in the US. Many restaurants in Singapore get away with serving average food and charging a high price in spite of it, because of the high density of Singapore. There are always more unsuspecting or willing diners who need to eat out, no matter how lousy you are. So restaurants just need to be very average. That's why the food standard here is relatively low. But most people here wouldn't understand it until they have lived abroad.","690":"As we darted through the crowded streets of Little India this little gem really stood out. \u00a0It just felt friendly, even from the street, and that turned out to be totally correct.We were greeted by a lovely woman who felt more like your Mom than a hostess. She urged us to try the upstairs barefoot dining... uh, yes please! \u00a0Sounds fun!The interior of the upstairs is ultra minimal, just a few low tables with pillows to sit on and some lanterns for atmosphere. \u00a0It was filled with young expats, mostly from the UK from what I could tell from their accents. \u00a0We ordered the chicken masala, palak paneer, garlic naan and some rice. \u00a0The hostess suggested we keep the spice level around a 1.5 or a 2. \u00a0Having eaten quite a bit of Indian food but not feeling like having a super spicy meal, we went with the 2. \u00a0HOLY COW was it spicy! \u00a0So much so it kind of took away from our enjoyment of the food.It was pretty pricey but a fun experience. \u00a0Definitely kind of more of a tourist trap type place than for locals, but worth trying.","691":"Great Food, esp. the butter chickenbut actually just everything was really tasty with a perfect spicyness. The service is equally great \u00a0really friendly and helpful. Even though we only spend 4 days in Sinpagore, we just had to go there twice because the food was just too good.","692":"This place is overpriced and the food is normal. They charge you for items that are complementary in other restaurants. I suggest try a different Indian restaurant. I was traveling to singapore and went there on recommendations based on networking sites.","693":"Lagnaa tops little india for me in terms of concept. They are all about chilies and spices where you can choose the level of spice that you would like to consume over there. There are up to 10 levels of spice and the highest level anyone has ever achieved is 9. You have to progress your way up the spice ladder whereby you can start at level 6 and only once that is complete, can you go up to level 7 and so forth. These challenges can only take place on a full moon. You even have to put a little clip on the wall and write your name after you successfully complete a spice challenge. Can you think of a restaurant with a more unique concept? They have an incredible egg plant dish named kathiri pachadi that i would highly recommend.","694":"good quality of food, nice service, great experienceWe've been to Lagnaa with a group of 8 people and had foot on the 2nd floor, where it was for mostly all of us the first time dining barefoot while sitting on the floor.Shanti - the host of the restaurant - was very nice and helped a lot during the reservation and ordering. She even took some pictures and mailed them to us afterwards. very nice!Food quality was very good, the highlight for me personally was the different types of Nan, which I never have had before. Rest of the food was also good, comparable to other good Indian restaurants I've already been.All of us really enjoyed this experience and we left the restaurant satisfied. Highly recommendable if you seek for a good Indian Restaurant in Little India.","695":"Lagnaa has a lovely ambience, friendly staff, and incredible Indian food. The walls out front of the restaurant have the scribbles of many a satisfied customer, and we weer all encouraged to leave out mar as well! The first floor has tables and chairs for those who aren't used to sitting on the floor, but as we had no problems with it, we took off our shoes and went upstairs for the barefoot dining experience.The upstairs is air-conditioned and clean, with several small tables and cushions on the ground. It's a rather intimate and authentic experience with ambient indian music playing in the background.We waited a very long time for the food - at least 30 minutes. Whilst waiting, they served up papadoms with a delicious mint chutney as appetizers. Our food finally arrived, and it was definitely worth the wait. The portions are somewhat small, so it's great for a small group of friends to order different items to share. It is also ideal for couples.The yoghurt rice was fragrant and had a wonderful texture to it. It really whetted my appetite and was perfect \u00a0for eating curries with. The chicken biryani, likewise, was an instant favourite amongst us, brimming with amazing flavours from the numerous spices used. I found the prices a bit steep here, but for a treat every once in a while, it's definitely worth your money to come to Lagnaa.","696":"I always judge an ethnic restaurant by its diners, and at lagnaa all of the other diners looked like me; westerners!! \u00a0In the heart of Little India it's a little disappointing to not see more indians dining alongside you, but at the same time this could have a lot to do with the price-point. \u00a0While the food was great, I felt there wasn't a good value for the price. \u00a0We chose to eat outside rather than upstairs, so perhaps I would've felt differently had we been in the ambiance of the \"barefoot dining\". \u00a0The staff was incredible and definitely displayed the Indian hospitality that I've come to love. \u00a0This type of service is hard to come by in Singapore, and almost justifies their high prices.While their menu wasn't anything new in terms of Indian cuisine, the drink menu had a few surprises. \u00a0If you like chai tea, I would definitely recommend the masala margarita. \u00a0It's much different than any margarita I've ever had, and in a delicious way!This would be a great place to bring out of towners as they will get to experience dining in the heart of little india, but without the chaos that accompanies some of the other venues in little India.","697":"Worst Indian restaurant in Singapore.. the concept, food quality and the prices are all a rip off.","698":"I came here a couple of years back - when they first opened. I was looking for a place with an interesting take to Indian Cuisine - and a friend recommended this place to me. So, I thought, why not? When I went, it was really empty thought - and I ate upstairs - and we were the only ones.What I Love: They have an interesting menu. Then, they had a seafood cheese fondue thing - which was pretty cool. And their breads were nice and yummmy. The upstairs part is barefoot dining and it is pretty cosy and has a good feel to it. It's a good spot to have a different kind of dining experience.What I Didn't Love: Their prices were wayyy wayy wayyy wayyy wayy off. Thought it was wayyy too steep for me. It came up to $100 just for 2 people? And when I asked them, they said the fondue is pretty much the reason. It's just melted cheese! And the service was kinda slow.","699":"Amongst all the craziness of Little India, Lagnaa Barefoot is a solace of peace and quiet. The upstairs dining room is perfect for a retreat with delicious food. We had all vegetarian dishes, but you couldn't tell because all the flavors were so delicious and bold. Take off your shoes, relax, and take in the smells and tastes of India.","700":"Always wanting to get my name on the hall of fame, i've made friends with the awesome crew here who chats with me when time permits. The service here is impeccable and they have their delish food to match it as well. Yoghurt rice is a must! Followed by a taste of the special of that month. The boyfriend loves the kathari pachidi, a stir fried eggplant with spicy tomato sauce. I love the aloo gobi here and the fish tikkas. Always so well prepared and you can even pick your spiciness level!","701":"The old airport road food centre has a lot of popular stalls selling hawker fare. One of these is Lao Fu Zhi Char Kway Teow (stir fried rice noodles).There is always a long queue but orders are taken very efficiently & served up fairly quickly by the aunty & uncle respectively. This dish is cooked using rice noodles, stir fried with bean sprouts, cockles, dark\/sweet soy sauce & pork lard, imparting a slightly sweet savoury taste. Definitely a must try for first timers to this food centre.","702":"When someone mentioned to me about having a meal at Old Airport Food Centre, this stall comes into my mind! I have always been a fan of this and often queue up very long just to enjoy the Char Kway Teow (Black or White) - Stir Fried Rice Noodles. So this time, I went there on a weekday and to our surprise, no queue at all. I couldn't believe my eyes! Less than 5 minutes, I had my food on the table and seconds later, my digestive system was at work! However, my tongue bud wasn't impressed with the 'stuff' going into my stomach as I was wondering, what happened? Is the quality of the food the reason why the lack of queue? All these instantly came into my mind. The more I chew on the food. The less impressed I was. The quality of it has certainly dropped! It wasn't what I expect but it's still decent enough to come and enjoy it. I have certainly tasted better ones elsewhere. Perhaps I should return another day to try it again to confirm whether the standard has indeed dropped or this meal I had was just an one-off.","703":"Probably one of the most famous stalls in Old Airport Road, the queue grows quickly but the uncle also cooks quickly. The stall can be recognized by the music playing out of the boombox, and the auntie who takes orders very quickly. You can be the 10th person down the line and she's asking for your order! The kway teow was very wet and wasn't too oily, the flavour was there and I didn't eat chunks of lard but I could definitely taste the use of lard.","704":"I cannot say it's no good because it was tasty but neither can I say that it was out-of-this-world kind of awesome too!Let's just say that I would order it if there is no queue but I wouldn't queue for it.","705":"Taste was good but not exceptional. Ingredients very stingy..Extremely poor value for money.. $5 buys you a few slices of lap Cheong, a few cockles, a tiny bit if egg, and that's it.","706":"Fried kway teow is basically the Singaporean version of the more popular (within the US) Cantonese dish of chow fun, but honestly it's much better because of the amount of other stuff you'll get in it like prawns, fishcake, cockles, egg, and Chinese sausage all served steaming hot on a banana leaf.A long queue at this particular stand; one of the longer ones along with Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee. \u00a0This line moves much quicker however. \u00a0The fried kway teow made here was easily the best I had while I was in Singapore.","707":"One of the trickiest things to assess is how good a dish is after a very long queue. It could very well be that the enjoyment of eating it was in large part due to the hunger accumulated \u00a0through the wait, but I'd like to ultimately think that it's all about the food.I've had some pretty good char kway teows in my time and this is definitely up there. If you can get past the fact that you might expect to wait for a good half an hour, it is everything you'd expect it to be. There is that sense that they have done this so often, and so well, that they almost can't do this in any other, nor could they ever do a bad plate. The man at the frying pan is all well kit up, complete with special glasses to prevent oil from splashing at him etc so you know he means business. My favourite parts of their char kway teow are the very distinct bits of egg you'll find unevenly lacing each bit spoonful of it. One confusing thing about this stall is their difference in pricing - they sell plates going at $3\/4\/5\/8\/10, and I haven't tried a wide enough range to know the difference.The plate I got today was for $5 and I have a inkling that the $5\/8\/10 versions come with prawns, which I werent a fan of because they weren't very well cooked, it's always a hassle peeling them and they don't contribute to the taste of the char kway teow at all.I also noticed that when you order more than one plates, while waiting to serve the next plate the lady serving you would cover your first plate with another plate, so the heat is kept in, a sight that while understated, tells me how meticulous they are in providing good service and good food, and that they care about how it tastes to us, even after the money has been passed.","708":"I went to the branch at Singapore Expo. Noodle texture was good. Lots of gravy, too sweet. Way too sweet. Cockles were over cooked, I'm okay with that. Must find a better store as this is way too sweet.","709":"It is amazing how many people queue for fried kway teow at this store, leaving almost no business for other similar stalls at Old Airport Road Food Centre.I was actually hoping for white leaf plates but in any case the dish was served on a disposable plate with pandan leaves. My colleagues thought it was too spicy for them but I thought it was alright. The variety here is drier but the flavours are well-balanced. Pretty generous amount of cockles mixed into it too. I thought it was lacking in the wok hei flavour I will like at a hawker centre but it is a pretty decent plate to have.Apparently, you can request to have your fried kway teow done with lard. I've heard amazing things about what lard can do to food from my mum. This makes it pretty enticing to try. I mean, if you want to indulge, might as well go all the way.","710":"Best dim sum in town. The restaurant comes direct from Hong Kong and the quality of the dim sum can't be beat. Although I have to say that my favorite has gotta be their double-boiled soup. Get the daily soup and it's not that bad in pricing. The chef also produces innovative dim sum that has a twist to the traditional dishes. One of my recent favorites is the fried you tiao with enoki mushrooms stuffed in it. Yums!Dessert is also lovely. The mango pomelo sago dessert is very yummy. Perfect for a hot summer day with just the right amount of sweetness and freshness provided by the fruits and pulp.Although situated on the third floor of an old building, you don't feel that it's the case once you step inside. Nice ambience with beautifully renovated interior and a view to the greeneries outside with the glass windows. Agree with the other reviews that the wait staff definitely tries to upsell you. Although, all you have to say is no, not interested and they will politely back down. Stand up for yourself and it'll only be mildly annoying. But agreed, 4 stars instead of 5.","711":"L \u00a0ift lobby reception area is small and cramp.E nvironment within is newly renovated.I \u00a0 ncredibly pushy staff who tries to sell you only their most expensive items!!!G uests here are mainly tourists!!!A \u00a0verage dishes at best. suckling pig and roast pork crispy but dry and porky meat.R elentlessly pushy staff even tried to sell their bottled appetizer for $18!!!D im sum touted as fresh from the oven was far from it, soggy crispy fried squid.E xpensive as can be!!! double boiled fish soup was $48, serves only 3.N ever again!!!","712":"I find the dim sum here not too shady. Was under the impression that it is very posh and expensive due to the luxurious interior but it was quite reasonably priced. I like that it's very comfortable and not that noisy. The quality of the dim sum is quite good. I love the succulent huge prawns in their har gao. The char siew bao is also very fluffy and juicy. They have a chocolate custard salted egg yolk bun which is quite ok but not fantastic.","713":"Lei Garden is a high end chinese restaurant. It serves exquisite chinese food. We ordered roast pork, peking duck and winter melon soup. Out of the 3, my favourite goes to winer melon soup. I can really taste the sweetness of the winter melon soup. Had a total of 3 bowls in total!As for peking duck, i find the sauce abit too salty and sweet. For the amount of price of dining here, i think i would be able to find better peking duck elsewhere.This is a good chinese restaurant with great ambience however, considering the price, i may not be back again.","714":"Here's a place that i use to frquent but recently after its renovation rather it's really expensive and the crew hard sells and service depends on your expenditure. They aren't the friendliest like they used to when we were regulars.I had dinner there recently with about 5 dishes, including a fried noodle, steam fish, a vegetable dish and another meat dish and the bill came up to $600! It can be really pricey here now, but at least the dim sum is still quite good. Here's one place you HAVE to reserve seats in advance though. There's no way to have a weekend breakfast with reservation if you're a group of 4 and more.","715":"As a child, we used to have family meals at Lei Garden frequently. For me, the dim sum trolleys were a reminder of the Sunday lunches of my childhood where we would grab everything and anything we liked with all the freedom that we, as children, were entitled to. It was with these same fond memories that we ate at Lei Garden again after many years of not visiting the restaurant, but either I'd grown up or the place has changed quite a bit since I'd last been.For one, the quality of the dim sum was not as I'd remembered it. My favourite dim sum is har gow and I would also eat as much of it as I could, but the har gow skin seemed to have become thicker than I remembered which made it far less enjoyable. The quality in general has certainly dropped a great deal but the price is still just as expensive. With the numerous dim sum places available at a more reasonable price, it is unlikely that I will visit Lei Garden again for the food.","716":"My friends and I decided to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival by having dinner at Lei Garden, which turned out to be top-notch for ambience and only passable for food.The place is swanky, I'll give you that. Fine bone china, multiple chopsticks (you know a Chinese restaurant is fancy when they give you more than one pair of chopsticks), cream-coloured walls and seats, thick linen napkins, and high-quality tea.For starters, we had some crispy roasted pork, cut into cubes and dipped into mustard sauce. I have never really understood the appeal of crispy roasted pork, but it's a Canton thing so I suppose Cantonese people like it. For me, I could only admire the fact that the pork was cut into perfect cubes without crumbling the crispy skin. Now how did they manage to do that? This puzzled me for a good part of the evening.A glistening roast duck suddenly appeared next to our table and disappeared just as quickly. They cut the skin into thin squares and wrapped them in a flour wrapper before serving to our table. The duck skin was roasted to crisp perfection but unfortunately tasteless. I slathered on generous amounts of tian mian jiang (Peking duck sauce) and just enjoyed the textures in my mouth - crispy skin, fresh cucumber, and soft flour wrapper.The most savoury dish was probably the twice-cooked pork belly, using pork bell with nice thick layers of fat. This is a traditional Chinese dish called dong bo rou) from Hangzhou, which is close to my home province of Jiangsu. This is usually one of my favourite dishes, but at Lei Gardens, the taste was not at all authentic.The latter half of the meal was filled with rather ordinary and uncomplicated dishes: stewed cabbage with mushrooms, stir-fried asparagus, fried rice, and fried noodles. Simple but well executed.By Singapore standards, this was decent Chinese food, but for this price, I would rather take my money elsewhere.","717":"I have been a regular customer at this stall. This is my go to bakuteh stall.Pork trotter - the sauce tastes great with the rice. Meat is tender and breaks apart easily. The pork fat melts in your mouth. Pork rib soup - soup can be more flavorful. Lacks the herbal taste. The soup is refillable free of charge and we usually go for second rounds.","718":"Leon Kee sells mainly pork ribs soup that is cooked in a thick herbal broth. The soup will come in a small claypot which keeps it warm while you enjoy it slowly with your bowl of rice. The pork ribs are rich with the flavor of the herbs and cooked long enough so that the meat comes off easily from the bones. They also sell prawn noodles in a claypot and braised pork trotters which are very good as well. The pork trotters is tender but not overcooked.Long ago, they used to sell their bak kut teh with real tea - you can order Chinese tea to go with your bak kut teh soup but due to space constraints, they have stopped doing so. What a pity...","719":"Tasty soup! Very herbal and for people who have strong taste buds. Other dishes like the salted veg were not warm when served. So will only go back for the ribs & soup nothing else. Have tasted other better ribs as well.","720":"This is a truly great dining establishment. It well deserves its 2 Michelin stars. I had the Tasting Menu for lunch together with a 1\/2 bottle of burgundy. It started with a selection of breads and French butter, then an amuse-bouche. The next four servings were: (1) cold angel hair pasta with caviar & truffle, (2) langoustine, (3) pan seared duck foie gras, & (4) French river salmon, all followed with the main course of Roasted Duck with spring turnip. Then dessert, of course. The service and ambiance could not be better.","721":"Two Michelin star French cuisine in Orchard. Serves traditional French cuisine. We went there for lunch which was a relatively good price for fine dining (~130\/pax). The courses include: amuse bouche, cold soup, salmon tartare, langoustine, duck and dessert. We find the food overall good but not spectacular, and frankly underwhelming given my high expectations of a Michelin star. The food just felt a bit too safe. Yes, the techniques and quality of ingredients were top-notch but the meal was just lacking in creativity to become particularly memorable. Favorite dishes were the langoustine (fresh \/ simple but really well-cooked) and the baba dessert (not too sweet, rich but balanced)Service was excellent, a true Michelin star level service. Large and good quality wine selection. Sommelier is quite helpful and gives good recommendation on the wine. They also gave us free macaroons to take as souvenir.","722":"Every time I visit Singapore I have to hit at least one Michelin starred restaurants as there are quite a few in the city! This time we picked Les Amis and it didn't disappoint! We did the Tasting Menu which was perfectly executed with every dish revealed to us from a perfectly withdrawn dome - old school French style. We loved the drama as you don't see it much these days. The service was also top-notch as we felt completely doted on by our multitude of servers. The standouts on the menu were the challen duck (cooked perfectly!) and the langoustine with olive oil emulsion - divine! The menu didn't disappoint and if you want an old school fine dining experience while visiting Singapore, Les Amis fills that bill. :)","723":"Standard awesome French food. Lost a star for a nit-picky-i-can't-believe-im-such-a-snob kinda way. My gripe was that I called ahead for my fiances bday cake. And it was totally forgotten by the staff. I waited 45 minutes after the end of the meal, because I thought it was still coming until the table next to mine got a cake. Then I said something, but it was too late. We just got an extra dessert with a candle in it. Really disappointing.","724":"Les Amis, helmed by Chef de cuisine Sebastien Lepinoy, is ranked 12th in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2016. Opened since 1994, they are one of the longest standing fine-dining restaurants in Singapore. During my week-long trip to Singapore in January, I managed to secure a lunch reservation at their establishment.Les Amis offers several dining options with seasonally crafted menus which ranges from 65$+ to $295+. We opted for 'Le Menu Tasting' which showcases 6 dishes for $155 per person. It's comprised of one cold appetizer, two hot appetizers, two main courses and one dessert.Dining at Les Amis was a lovely experience. Their angel hair pasta signature dish was to die for. The whole team takes a lot of pride in their work and I commend them for it. If you're looking for a straightforward contemporary French fine dining experience with a high level of finesse, Les Amis is the place to be.","725":"Located in Shaw Theater, Les Amis is one of the oldest French fine dining in Singapore so it was a must try in our book. We came here for Valentines 2016 and were pleasantly surprised with a simple and sophisticated decor, which we thought was similar to Jean George in New York. We opted for the Le Menu Classic course, reasonably priced at $185\/person. The flavors of the dish, the service, and the atmosphere fell together perfectly (nothing to nitpick about this pl) and we left a happy couple by the end of the night. Will return!

Almost boring :-s Not what I was expecting! \u00a0And in fact it's all about the expectations. This place is easily a five star, if compared to all the Singapore restaurants out there. However, when compared to the top restaurants... It fails. \u00a0Andre keeps the crown for best restaurant in Singapore for me.","727":"Best meal I've had in Singapore. A classic, classy, upscale, quiet, clean, warm, friendly French restaurant. Be warned, they don't really have an \"A La Carte\" menu. They have 3 set menus from $150-$300 and several \"to share\" dishes. We each ordered the $150 \"Decouverte\" menu which included:Steamed Blue Crab and Hokkaido Sea Urchin on Lobster Custard with Fennel Foam - Rich and deliciousCrispy Cornouaille Langoustine, with a mini caesar salad - DeliciousSeasonal Corn Soup with chives - served piping hot with a few caramel corns on the side, rich but balancedHungarian Charcoal-Grilled Pork Rack With Carrots Confit and potato puree - The pork was super tender, the puree impeccable and the carrots delicious. My co-workers opted for Wild Scottish Salmon, one confit and one tartare.Dessert was Dark Chocolate Souffle with Tahiti Vanilla Ice Cream -ice cream was the most vanilla-ee I've ever had.I felt very satisfied with the meal, and felt it was actually good value despite the cost. A special note, they have FOUR kinds of butter and 3 kinds of bread: Baguette, sourdough and focaccia. \u00a0The mini baguettes were incredible. The butters are smoked (delicious), seaweed (salty), spicy and salted. I tried each and they were all good in their own way, perhaps the best butters I've ever had. Service was great, they explained each item since I didn't remember what any of the courses were. The wine list is as thick as a dictionary but they have affordable wines and wines by the glass. The restaurant is pretty small and intimate, and their wine cellar is a digital glass walk in safe-room. I will certainly return next time I come to Singapore.","728":"I had the good fortune to get invited by a friend to thisincredible restaurant and just returned. \u00a0Restaurants frankly don't get any better than this. \u00a0Formal wear is a must and frankly this would be the place to wear the nicest thing you own. \u00a0I even busted out a brand new suit for the occasion and was happy that I did so. \u00a0The menu was incredible and I will list the various things we tried out. \u00a0We didn't exactly stick to the set menu because one of the people I was with has a daughter who works at the restaurant and was frankly showing off all the signature items (and I am soooo happy that she did). \u00a0Good lord. \u00a0The presentation and explanation of all items was damn impressive and helped me out because several of these items are not on my normal menu :) \u00a0Here is a list of items we sampled:STEAMED WHITE ASPARAGUSwhite asparagus from provence, served with a traditional mousseline sauceSPECIAL SELECTION OF KRISTAL CAVIARcold angel hair in harmony with black truffle & caviar balanced with an exquisite aroma of kombu &chivesFOIE GRAS & EELpan seared foie gras and french river eel in combination with citrus fruit compote and dashiJAPANESE OMI BEEFgrilled japanese beef with asparagus and traditional \"poivrade\" sauceBABY LAMBbaby lamb rack from \"luberon\" with ratatouilleDark Chocolate P125 Souffle withTahiti Vanilla CreamALPHONSO MANGOin a sugar sphere with coconut sorbet","729":"the food is decently - and might I say, perhaps technically - perfect, but there was nothing particularly surprisingly or wow-ing; service is efficient if a little intrusive, since they belong to that class where waiters are aloof and almost slightly standoff-ish (how they manouevre around my photo-shooting also tells me a little of their skill); and the restaurant is lovely, if a little too cold (feel rather than absolute temperature).the bread basket arrives with an array of carbs that brought variety rather than any particularly impressive taste - the sugared orange brioche was best. this was followed by a foie gras mousse-type with mackerel and my garlic-spicy gazpacho - small portions but well judged so. our amuse bouche was a deviled egg livened up by plump ikura - perhaps the most surprising dish (though still JUST a deviled egg).two scallops in their shells made up the best part of the meal - seared lovely and topped with soft chopped mushrooms and a lovely jus - and were definitely worth the extra.and our mains of a shrimp-topped pasta and seared beef continued the theme of good-but-not-special - it's all decently done, as the photos show very well, but we still waiting for the oomph (so ephemerally delivered by the scallop course).dessert was a play on mangos - a shortbread base topped with ripe cubes and puree, as well as a thick mango lassi topped with pistachios. pretty good - but there was such a savoriness about the tart that completely defied its status as dessert (and made me have an ice cream later for my sweet tooth).and to finish it all, we were brought a complimentary dish of madeleines and lemon curd - utterly delicious. buttery, crusty, and soft with fine crumbs, these are spectacular specimens of the french confectionary.this is a tempered review if nothing else - I would certainly return, though most likely only if I weren't paying - because I like my food (especially when expensive) to be spectacularly good, or at least interesting. but it well deserves its status as bastion of fine-dining traditions in our tiny country - and would serve your purposes best (if you find them aligned to those of busy businessmen).","730":"One of the best restaurants in Singapore. The food was amazing from appetizer to main dish. Subtle influence of Japanese way of cooking, which makes the course very unique and nice. I really enjoyed the dinner and wine there, and I can recommend this restaurant for special occasion.","731":"This is the quintessential posh and good French restaurant where you have a pay a pretty penny and get amazing food, service and ambience. It is definitely a great choice for a special dinner if you want to impress. There is nothing you can really fault their food (all cooked and flavored to perfection) and their service (attentive but not intrusive nor condescending) for. They only do set menus here so it is quite pricey for dinner but they have a more reasonably priced lunch menu (Saturdays included!), so it is possible to try some of their yummilicious food without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!","732":"A great place for lunch and for Singapore the wine prices are quite reasonable.I've never been disappointed with the food or the service and it's definitely a favorite spot I can always rely on for a great meal.","733":"I had a really good meal here; service was impeccable and food was delish but it felt a little overrated and the ambience was not the best. Enjoyed myself but not sure i'd come back","734":"Superb dining experience in a wonderful romantic setting. We have been four times now and look forward to many more. Really a place for a special occasion. Fine dining that deserves at least one Michelin Star (I have been to many inferior Michelin restaurants) but somehow seems to have been overlooked so far. However it seems to be improving every time we go so maybe in the next round? Exemplary discrete and attentive service to match the delicious art on the plate.","735":"Looking for a romantic spot for a date or for an intimate wedding? Consider Lewin Terrace, a Japanese-French fusion restaurant housed in a gorgeous black & white bungalow and nestled amidst the lush greenery of Fort Canning. Take it from the experts, my dining party of bridal publication writers said that Lewin Terrace serves the best food in their category (boutique wedding restaurants i reckon). I definitely agree with the made-in-heaven marriage between Japanese and French cuisine, which was made better by Executive Chef Keisuke Matsumoto and his team of chefs. Lewin Terrace's signature set dinner and seasonal lunch menus change every three months due to its produce-driven philosophy. Here's a look at what we had for their special World Gourmet Summit 2017 menu, along with some wine-sake pairing from their extensive and exclusive wine list. We were lucky to try the dishes prepared by Chef Keisuke Matsumoto and critically-acclaimed pastry chef Kiriko Nakamura from Tirpse for this collaboration.Wagyu Mont Blanc by Matsumoto. The delicate Kagoshima tartar is flavored with capers, oregano and topped with a garlic crust and sweet black garlic puree. The mont blanc is made with lily root puree, which is flavored with truffle. More from the man, the Sendai-style Bouillabaisse. A firm rock fish is used in this dish and we enjoyed the intense seafood flavor from the little mussels. The dish is a lot lighter than the usual in terms of mouthfeel but it's certainly not lacking in the flavor department. My fear of pigeons were somewhat squashed with Matsumoto's version (because #coffeelove). The roasted pigeon is prepared with cacao, coffee and chocolate, and the any possible gaminess was covered by the ginger-red wine-coffee jus. This reminds me of a home-cooked dish of stir-fried liver with ginger.For some luxe comfort food, the Hayashi rice with beef and onion with demi-glaze. This is perfect with the Madena.Then we had 3 desserts by Chef Kiriko Nakamura from Tirpse (1 Michelin star). While it's still sakura season, have some pretty pink Sakura sake which has the scent of strawberries. This pale pink drink is like a moscato with a lighter hint of honey. This goes perfect with Kiriko's next plate of spring, an interesting mix of snap pea sponge with Chitose strawberry and sakura ice cream. The pea sponge may be a little weird on its own but it breaks the sweetness of the strawberries and Sakura.","736":"The place was located just behind the Singapore Philatelic Museum. It shared the carpark with the museum with valet service provided. The place was a black and white colonial style bungalow.As there was an event which occupied the indoor dining area, I was showed to a table in the alfresco area. Although there was no aircon, the place was quite cooling. I was having the 3 course French Week promotional lunch set which cost $40++. Amuse-bouche : Sweet Potato SoupThe soup had a taste similar to potato soup but with a sweet taste.This was followed by the bread basket and butter. There was 3 different kinds of bread which were served pipping hot. There was hot stones underneath the bread to keep the bread warm.LES ENTREEs : Galantine\/ Japanese Raison \"Kyoho\"\/ Creme De VermouthChicken\/ Foie Gras\/ Kyoho\/ Creme VermouthThe rather unexciting chicken roll was lifted up in taste by the sour and sweet tasting grapes and the sweet pickled onions. LE PLAT : Terrine De Poisson\/ Mangue Vert Spagetti\/ Sauce AmericainePrawn\/ Fish Terrine\/ Green Mango Spaghetti\/ American SauceThe green mango spaghetti turned out to be shredded mango. It did not taste sour although it was green mango. The fish terrine was more like fish cake with fish meat stuffed in the centre. The americaine sauce was made of crayfish with strong seafood taste, which peak up the otherwise bland fish terrine.LE DESSERT : Creme Brulee Lewin Terrace StyleThe dessert was served in a glass, different from the usual creme brulee. It was pudding, topped with ice cream, banana and caramel crisp. Interesting and did not taste too sweet.Yaki-Imo ($24++)Sweet Potato\/ Caramel Ice Cream\/ MapleThe dish was presented as sweet potato crispy leave with chocolate branch sticks. I was disappointed that the caramel ice cream was already melted when served. The sweet potato was smooth and creamy, topped with purple sweet potato powder.Overall the dishes were not bad, but still lacking of the wow factor. The place was an interesting cozy one.","737":"This place has so much going for it, historical setting, secluded dining, the finesse of French cooking combined with the attention to detail of the Japanese. \u00a0But somehow it still fails to tick all the boxes.Sure, the meals are well prepared, and the service is top class. \u00a0But for fine dining, you'd expect the chef to have tested out the flavour combinations, layering, profile, texture etc, to make sure it all comes together in an orchestra of delight. In this aspect, the Lewin Terrace has been a let down.Still, if its the company you're keeping that is more important, or a deal you're trying to strike with an important client, and their tastebuds aren't as sharp as their egos, then this place might be the place you're looking for after all.Who knows? I may be back again in future, perhaps when it isn't necessary to tick all the boxes.","738":"If you're looking for a secluded place on a date and your partner isn't a foodie, this can be the place - just be mindful that the restaurant might only satisfy the desire for good ambiance but not taste buds. Had a $108 (per pax) 5-course set menu but ended up with slight disappointment. Appetizer consists of a slimy, tasteless jar of veg jelly, which is not very appetizing...the disproportional bowl of noodle soup can be improved. Main course - grilled duck with asparagus was one of the only few things that really make up the meal, oh and the complimentary Riesling too! I'll give the thumb up on the attentive service too.","739":"First, know that the location in Google Maps points you to the top of the Fort Canning Hill. Lewin Terrace is closer to the base of the hill, behind the old Central Fire Station and the Philatelic (Stamp) Museum. Double-check the location if you decide to walk, before you force your date to walk up a hill in high heels, then walk down again. Anywho, most of the dishes were delicious, although a few just barely missed the mark. The service was exquisite- my girlfriend and I came here to celebrate a special day and they prepared an inscribed dessert just for us, took our photo with it, then printed the photo and delivered it in a frame to the table! I literally registered for Yelp in order to express my appreciation for the wonderful service and to heartily recommend Lewin Terrace as a wonderful and romantic option.","740":"This is a fine dining restaurant ... The address didn't really reveal the exact location .. B sure to come in from the fire station which sits at the entrance of the road up to registry of marriages .. Alight at the philatelic Museum .. There's a sign at the entrance that indicates the entrance ... Please use this route especially if you are all dressed up for your date .. The other route from Dolby ghaut is definitely a challenging route .. Do not attempt to walk if you are all dressed up .. So much for getting there ... It's a romantic and quiet place for dating couples or if you want a quiet place in the setting of an old colonial bungalow ... The price is reasonable for the setting ... Food is impressive and service is v good ... Try the sake and wine pairing if you are not driving","741":"By the last day of my trip, I had eaten all of the above, visited other hawker stalls, and even enjoyed a 10-course meal at Jaan, named one of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants in 2017. With the bar set this high, I finally arrived at Hawker Chan's. When I stepped into the small restaurant, I was surprised to see Chef Chan behind the glass, brows furrowed and in deep concentration as he rapidly prepared rice and noodle plates for the lunch crowd. To my surprise, he looked up to wave when it was my turn to order at the counter. I would soon learn that this display of warmth, which was unexpected given his level of fame these past years, was also somehow transferred to his food creations. Some say the difference between a good dish and an exemplary dish is that the latter is cooked with love. As I placed the first spoonful of rice and chicken into my mouth, I understood this sentiment. Every bite of chicken was tender, and every morsel of rice fragrant. Chef Chan turned this very ordinary dish into something amazing. I looked around and watched as other customers -- customers from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Canada and Beijing -- savored every bite. lowdownonchinatown.com\/h\u0085","742":"Had to make a visit here - cheap and has a michelin star? Went on a Thursday afternoon, around 1 pm and the place was sooo packed.You order\/pickup from the counter and all seating is self-seating. Although there's plenty of seats, it took some time to find a seat for 2 because it was so crowded.My boyfriend and I each ordered their famous soya chicken and rice dish. I ordered the roasted pork with noodles and the bf ordered the chair siu with noodles. My take on each dish:-Soya chicken and rice: The chicken was tender, but a little dry. I ended getting a portion with a ton of bones, whereas my bf said his was boneless. The rice was cold and hard - blegh! Was disappointed with this dish.-Roast pork with noodle: I enjoyed this dish more than the soya chicken dish. The noodles were tasty and the pork skin had a nice crunch to it. The bf said he liked the char siu dish with noodles. Worth a try, but I didn't understand the hype. Maybe it's just this location? Other reviews said the original stand is better.","743":"Hawker Chan is supposedly the cheapest Michelin star restaurant in the world. For how much I paid ($3-5 USD for a plate of food), I guess I can't complain about my experience here, but in terms of the food itself, it's really just OK. Not bad, not great.Overall, it was fun to try once and say I've been to a Michelin star restaurant. However, given the long lines and crowds of tourists, I'd rather pay just a few dollars more next time at a different restaurant for food that's just as good.","744":"Hawker Chan is a great \"cheap\" eat for being on the Michelin list. Their claim to fame is their soy sauce chicken, which I tried. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful that paired well with plain white rice. I came on a Sunday morning around 11:30am, no line and easily found seating. I recommend using their electronic kiosk to order because that seems to be faster than ordering with the cashier. The kiosk accepts cash and credit cards, prints a receipt at the end to get your meal. I also ordered the bean sprouts, which I thought were too salty. The portions are plentiful for 2 people. Staff seems to work quickly to clear and clean tables. Overall, my experience was good, but I wasn't totally blown away.","745":"If you want to try out where Chan Hao Meng's Michelin star soya chicken all started, this is where you need to be. But let me remind you, this is in a Hawker Center - open air dining in hot and humid conditions. Since it's in a Hawker Center, there are several stalls that offer a variety of food and you just have to walk around patiently to find Hawker Chan. A good indication that you've found it is: the longest line in the entire Hawker Center!You place your order, find a table, and enjoy your meal - or take yours to-go. There's a charge for to-go containers.If you want the full experience and you're not the whiny type, come here. Otherwise, go to the air conditioned version across the street and pay extra for the slight convenience.I've tried their soya chicken, char siew, roasted pork, rice, and noodles. My favorite was the roasted pork - it's everything that's good with Chinese roasted pork. De-li-cious! The noodles tend to get cold quick so you might want to take a quick pic of your food for Instagram and eat right away.","746":"This place is pretty good, but maybe a little overrated. \u00a0The soya sauce chicken is good, but can be a little dry. \u00a0This location has plenty of seats. \u00a0I actually liked their char sew better. \u00a0Additionally, going over noodles was pretty good too. \u00a0I guess you can't beat the price for eating at a Michelin starred restaurant though.","747":"I had such a great expectation for this place and I was underwhelmed. \u00a0 Tried the ribs, char siu and crispy pork and I have definitely had better in other places in Singapore and other cities. \u00a0 \u00a0The price is right...most stuff less than US$5. \u00a0 \u00a0Their ordering system is cool...either order on a computer pad or at the counter...you can pay with credit card with the former. \u00a0 Not going back anytime soon for it.","748":"After hearing that Hawker Chan was the first hawker stand to received the coveted Michelin star it jumped to the top of the list of places to try during our trip back to Singapore. \u00a0After talking with a few locals, I was a bit reluctant to actually make the effort to check this place out. \u00a0All of them were in agreement that the soy sauce chicken was \"rubbish.\" \u00a0Not sure if it was because of what they thought of the food or if it was because of the drastic price increase after receiving the Michelin star. \u00a0We arrived about 30 mins before they opened and found ourselves at the front of the line. \u00a0It wasn't until 10 mins before the shop opened that the line started to get long. \u00a0It took around 10 mins before we were called to the counter to pick up the food. \u00a0Grabbed some condiments and headed to a table. \u00a0Ended up ordering half a chicken, a bowl of rice, rice noodles, and an order of bean sprouts. \u00a0The chicken was super tender and even the breast meat was super tender and all pieces of chicken were flavorful. \u00a0What sets this soy sauce chicken apart from all of the rest is with how well seasoned the chicken is and the unique flavor of the soy sauce they use. \u00a0It is evident in with their dark soy sauce they offer as a condiment as it has a smokiness to it. \u00a0The only complaint I have was with the bean sprouts. \u00a0Wished they cooked it longer as I personally don't like the taste of raw bean sprouts. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place as the soy sauce chicken did live up to the hype. \u00a0Didn't try any of the other bbq dishes but soy sauce chicken was awesome!!! \u00a0Oh and this location also boasts cold AC!!!","749":"Really cheap! The lines moved fast, wasn't hard to find a table at all. We ordered the famous soya chicken with rice and then a crispy roast pork with noodles and shared it among 3 of us. The sauce was really good, the chicken super moist and flavorful. Recommend it for sure if you're in Singapore!","750":"Hawker Chan is a must-go when in Singapore. My first-ever chicken rice was at Tian Tian so that's my standard. HC's chicken and rice were both drier than TT's. While HC's stands up well on its own, I would vote TT in a heartbeat.","751":"Known as one of the cheapest Michelin rated restaurant in the world this is a must try when in Singapore. Located within Singapore's Chinatown, it is a close walk to many other hawker stalls serving up all kinds of Asian fare. The key to this place is to get here early, as I showed up 45 min before it even opened and there was already 15 people in line. The food is good and well worth the visit, I ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish. The prices are reasonable so I would suggest stocking up on two plates and sampling something else on the menu. Singapore has plenty of Michelin rated restaurants, and other great dining options so make sure to explore around and find some hidden gems within the city.","752":"Amazing Chicken Rice, but honestly it was the pork that blew our mind. \u00a0My recommendation would be to get one of each! \u00a0Because after waiting in that line, you've earned it. Pro tip: Grab a beer at one of the many drink stalls to sip while you wait. \u00a0The line moves very slowly but it's totally worth it!","753":"One of famous Michelin starred hawkers! While \"hawker\" is still in the name, it is clear upon arriving that after the internationally recognized success and accolades Hawker Chan made his business into an established restaurant enterprise: there is a very organized numbered mode of ordering, a continuously looped video of Hawker Chan's origins on multiple screens in the space, and--perhaps most importantly--cold AC blasting over the numerous dining tables. I had the chicken and rice plate. The food is very simple, with straight-laced Chinese flavors. I don't know what Michelin starred food is supposed to be like, but while my meal was certainly appetizing and satisfying, it was nothing life-changing. However, the combo of well marinated meat + carbs + veggies + ice cold beer + AC amidst the heat and humidity outside should not be underestimated.","754":"It's hard to miss with the long queue. \u00a0Long wait? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I waited about 40 minutes before ordering, but once you order, you get your order within 1 - 3 minutes. \u00a0Worth the wait? \u00a0Debatable, but more on the yes side. \u00a0I think it's worthwhile for anyone that has to time to try, to try. \u00a0I mean, this is super affordable for anyone who's looking to try a Michelin star restaurant for no more than $2\/3 USD per item.The soya chicken is super fragrant and cooked perfectly moist and tender, but nothing that was out of the ordinary as I've had many similar items in Hong Kong. \u00a0I didn't particularly like the sambal or the red sauce that was on the side with my egg noodles. \u00a0Meh, I'd just stick to the chicken and rice. \u00a0We also got the char siu with rice, and again pretty disappointing. \u00a0It was too crispy on the outside (very charred) and too salty\/fatty for my liking. \u00a0Sauce over the rice was good though. \u00a0 Soya chicken and rice is the way to go.","755":"I came here twice at the end of August during my visit to Singapore. This review is strictly about the food. I love soy sauce chicken. I don't like white meat and always prefer the dark. That being said, this is the best soysauce chicken I've ever had in my lifetime thus far. Ever since I left singapore I've been craving it so much. It left such a strong impression on me that I now refuse to order soysauce chicken back home because I know I'll be disappointed. The chicken is so so so so tender!!! I ate the white meat, yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist!!! The one place I don't mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark! That says a lot for me. Also the soya is sweet and savory. They pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle. I do wish they gave a little more chicken though. After my first visit, I had to go back and get half a chicken. I also got a side order of the roasted pork and the Cha siu. Each time I've ordered these, they were always very flavorful and juicy. The pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious.Now I'm salivating and hungry and craving all this as I finish my review. P.S I also enjoyed the pickled chili peppers from the condiments section. I'd come back to Singapore just for the chicken.","756":"I rated this place 3-star in TripAdvisor for this reason: \"Had the description of 2-star rating isn't 'Poor' but 'Below Average', I would have rated it as 2 stars.\"Originally, I wanted to visit the 1 Michelin star rated Liao Fan HK Chicken Rice stall located at the Chinatown Food Complex opposite this shop. However unexpectedly, it was closed (on a Tuesday). So I'm left with no choice but to try this \"branch\" with a lower rating of mere Bib Gourmand. The experience was nothing short of a MAJOR disappointment. My original intention was to simply write: - Save as to the truly tenderness of chicken, nothing is special. - The chicken is flavour-less. - The soy sauce put on top of the rice does not make it taste different, just normal soy sauce. - Chilli sauce provided is a little weird in taste. - Add-on Roasted Pork is dry, although the skin is indeed crispy. - Food servers at the food collection counter has a TERRIBLE attitude problem, they cannot be bothered to wait for a mere 10-15 seconds of walking time from table seated to the counter but will simply spam and abuses the bell. Extremely rude in manners, simply \"swing\" the tray to your direction, instead of placing it still for your collection. I will not revisit this shop. However, I might still try Hawker Chan's chicken rice at the original shop in the food complex. Let's hope by the real man doing the dishes himself, all these Quality Control defects can be eliminated and I get to enjoy a truly amazing plate of chicken rice. Note:- Always try to visit the stall at second floor Chinatown Food Complex and only take this shop as a backup plan. - The stall opens at 10.00 a.m., multiple reviews suggests that you can avoid the queue by being there at 9.45 a.m. The same reviews suggest that their chicken might be sold out as early as 1 p.m. - According to Michelin's website, they are closed on Wednesdays.- If you're coming straight from Changi Airport, apparently the faster way of getting to this shop was to disembark at Outram Park MRT Station (East West Line) rather than Chinatown MRT Station. Visited 10 October 2017. Food ordered: Soya Sauce Chicken Rice (SGD 3.80), add-on Roasted Pork (SGD 3.00) - Major disappointment. Ordinary chicken rice.","757":"Wow, soy sauce chicken was really tender and yummy. \u00a0 Love it the best with mein.Accept credit card With AC","758":"Awesome food at a bargain prices! We paid S$18 for four dishes. Attached picture shows it all. Totally deserved Michele stars!","759":"Soy Sauce Roasted Chicken? Yes yes food here... highly recommended. However, other served dishes are soso only. Come for their specialty, very yummy....not recommended for noodle and etc.","760":"I'm not that into michellin. But at this price, you have no reason not to try. I personally like the noodles better than the rices.","761":"Lots of hype bc of the Michelin Star - and for the value, you sure can't beat it. \u00a0However, be aware that this is bone-in chicken and they chop it with bone-in - meaning you will be chewing and spitting out lots of tiny bone fragments. \u00a0This is fairly normal in Asia evidently, but as an American I was not prepared for it. \u00a0Away from that it very flavorful and an all around good experience. \u00a0Don't expect this to be a fancy spot though just bc it has a Michelin Star - think of it as maybe a step above a 7-11 in terms of ambiance...","762":"Food (1): For a Michelin star restaurant, I was severely disappointed in the food. To be fair, this could be my fault. I ordered the 3 BBQ Combo item. This included BBQ pork, Roasted Pork Belly and BBQ Ribs. Maybe I don't quite understand what Michelin means, especially for a \"hawker\". It's only after I sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their Soy Sauce Chicken. I thought Michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole, not just one dish, but I could be wrong. Maybe the Soy Sauce Chicken is worth a try. However, I can say for an absolute fact that the 3 BBQ Combo I got was just pure trash. BBQ pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce. Roasted Pork Belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat. On top of that the Skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily, crisp crunch. Ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce. As someone from the SGV area of SoCal, even he most average Chinese restaurant tops this place.Service (5): The line to order wasn't too bad and moved quickly. For some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier. But there was a order machine right next to them. I skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that. I really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so I am giving it a 5 because of that.Ambiance (3): You will notice I put hawker in quotes on the food section. This is because it's not really a hawker. It's a restaurant. Maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers, but not anymore. It's just a regular restaurant. Nothing special about it. It's pretty bland, but at least it's clean.Price (4): Decent and cheap price. However, this is an American's point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates.","763":"Saw the Michelin interview of the owner and his story. This was a must go to place when we visited Singapore. Sadly, I was disappointed. I ordered everything on the menu. The chicken was too salty and definitely have had better. Overall, everything was super oily and we left most of the food still on the dishes. Hopefully, it was an off day for the restaurant.","764":"Michelin one star cooking for less than the price of a McDonald's Big Mac? you can believe it.The restaurant is on Smith Street near one of the big streets. \u00a0A business group may have helped him relocate to this present location. \u00a0Don't know why Yelp is using the restaurant name as \"Liao Fan - Hawker Chan\" (unless this signage means: \u00a0for non-Chinese speakers, this is the Hawker Chan restaurant). \u00a0The English language signs show \"Hawker Chan\". \u00a0The blue awnings mention \"The world's first Michelin-starred street food stall\". \u00a0No experience of waiting in a \u00a0queue for us (although the restaurant is set up for long queues). \u00a0 I ordered the chicken with noodles (not rice) and vegetables. \u00a0Also a plate of the barbeque pork. The food quality and consistency is superb (and you get bragging rights for frugality\/ finding a \"cheap eats\".). \u00a0Mr. Chan deserves the accolades he has been given - a video of the Michelin award ceremony played on the video monitors in the restaurant \u00a0while we ate.","765":"Just had to see what the buzz is all about. The line was pretty long for a 3pm snack time. Waiters were a little cranky, which is normal for bustling places. Food was alright, not as good as I had expected but the sauce is definitely what separates it from the rest. The place is really nice for a local fast food, with lots of foreigners coming in & out of the store.","766":"As of March 2017, the one michelin star is awarded only for the original stall (Liao Fan). I understand the Hawker Chan outlets will be vying for a michelin star award later this year. Until then ... for me the real winner is the soya sauce chicken and even the sauce too. All other dishes\/sides are alright but nothing special about them. You can find equivalent quality for these other dishes\/sides elsewhere.I have tried here twice and enjoy having the noodles with soya sauce chicken. The rice seems quite popular here and so is the Hor Fun except that Hor Fun noodles do not arrive early. My colleague ordered it at 12nn but was told the noodles were not in yet.Waiting in this restaurant is quite comfortable.First you queue up to place an order. As you get nearer the counter, you will eventually have a choice of ordering via a vending machine or continue in the line to the counter staff. People tend to take quite some time at the vending machine so I take that to mean it's not user friendly enough. This ordering queue takes about 15-20 mins, based on the before 12nn crowds.After placing your order and paying up, you will be given a receipt with a queue number. Now you can go to your seat and look out for the TV monitors that show the queue number for food collection.So far, diners there will just eat and go and not much lingering around so you should be able to get a table fairly quickly.I will go back again - just for the chicken.","767":"We were in the are and decided to visit the place for lunch. Surprisingly it was not crowded. Just a couple of tables occupied. So we had our choice of table which was one overlooking the waterfront with natural lighting. After looking through the menu, we decided on the 3-course lunch set (S$30++) which includes a choice of soft or tea\/coffee. We had iced thai milk tea and iced tea with lime, which were rich and not too sweet.Chives CakesThe cakes looked and tasted like the teochew style ku chai kueh ??? (chives steamed rice cake). The version here had pan fried to give it a crispy crust. Felt that the skin was tab too thick. Wish that there was sambal chilli sauce to go with it.Cured Pork FrittersLight and crispy on the outside, but the filling was too little to make an impression.Kanom Jin Noodle served with Mash Prawn CurryThe prawn was minced quite finely. Although the sauce tasted more on the sour side, but one soon got used to it. Served with raw greens such as bean sprouts, long beans, cucumber, and mints.Chicken Biryani Thai Style with Tomato & Herb SoupSurprisely the dish did not use the long grain rice which was usually found in biryani in Singapore. The rice was flavourful and went quite well with the sweet tomato sauce. The chicken loooked dry and charred but was quite tender.Mango and Sweet Sticky RiceThe rice was soft and chewy, although it was be better had it been served hot. Topped with the juicy sweet mango and crispy crunchy mung beans.Durian Ice Cream with Sesame WaferThe sesame wafer looked like the Beehive Cookies (Kuih Rose) ??? which was usually available during festive season. It was light and crispy, which gave a savoury taste when accompanying the rich and creamy durian ice cream.Overall the food was great and the place was quite relaxing to be around.","768":"Long Chim means \"come & taste\" and serves up Thai street food by celebrity Chef David Thompson. Being a frequent visitor to Thailand & a fan of both their local street & restaurant food, this was something to look forward to in Singapore. LOCATION & AMBIENCE 3.5\/5Located on level 2 of Marina Bay Sands (MBS), together with a few other fine dining restaurants, Long Chim's entrance can be easily missed. Rather than at the signboard, the entrance is at a colourful stained glass wall about 30m before it. Just before the entrance, one can look down to the entire MBS casino floor with the smell of tobacco smoke wafting up. Whether it helps to whet one's appetite is subjective. The restaurant itself is bathed in the warmth of strategically located lighting mimicking inverted glass funnels, giving it an air of sophistication. After passing the bar, you are greeted by a circular dining area fronted by a \"street food cart\". At the back of the restaurant are where the food is prepared, while to the right are another row of cosy dining tables overlooking the MBS \"basin\" & foyer outside. While I was trying to take in the overall ambience, I kept thinking back to trying to figure out if this was a restaurant trying to serve street food or a street food place trying to be a restaurant. FOOD 2\/5After the build up from the ambience of the restaurant, the food that was served fell far short of expectations. The steamed plain white rice was dry & clumpy, the vegetarian fried spring rolls ($13) was too salty (even with the accompanied chilli dipping sauce), the grilled long eggplant with steamed egg salad ($24) was very sour (the only thing nice from it was the steamed egg with runny yolk), the green chicken curry ($24) portion was small with just a few chicken pieces & the green curry gravy (or sauce) could have been slightly thicker & stronger taste wise. The Thai iced milk tea ($10) was good & not too sweet. We decided not to proceed to try the desserts for fear of any further disappointment. SERVICE 3.5\/5The friendly staff are at hand to attend to your requests. Child seats are available on request, crayons are also provided, together with the kids menu, to be drawn on.VALUE 2.5\/5People will go to any place if the food is good, be it a push cart by the street or a restaurant. Unfortunately, in this case, I do not intend to return to savour the street food there.","769":"Against popular opinions, I would have to say this restaurant was not impressive at all. Set within the casino atrium and having Chef David Thompson to helm up this fine little (ok not so little) establishment, I do not think it was unreasonable to walk in with the expectations that it could be somewhat close to Nahm. Of course I wasn't expecting a Michelin star standard but..... \u00a0Their Pad Thai was too oily, most of the other dishes were average. The only memorable dishes I took away with for the night were their chive cakes (so good) and seaweed soup which kind of shows how mediocre the standard is. If I blindfolded myself, I would guess that their Tom yum soup was from Thai Express maybe (some mid class franchise across south east Asia- somewhat comparable to Panda Express in the States). Their cocktails are acceptable but nothing to scream about. Happy hour menu was Bottled chang and Leo. Asking me to have bottled beers (rather than draft) at a fancy place is just a no-no for me. Service wise was a mix of both. We had good service in the beginning but waited almost an hour for our second round of cocktails and my friend had to ask twice just for a glass of water. I know the concept behind this restaurant is just a fancy version of street food in Thailand. But there is just nothing special about this place. We paid close to S$700 for a group of 9.","770":"Long Chim is a Thai restaurant opened by David Thompson, chef at the celebrated restaurant Nahm in Bangkok. \u00a0While the concept is a little different, there are some similarities with mixed results. \u00a0At Long Chim, the theme is street food, and there is a wide variety of dishes from curries and noodles to salads and stir fries. \u00a0There is a $30 version of pad thai which was flavorful but too greasy and I would say that in general the food tends to run on the oily side but also a bit saltier and sweeter as well (sounds like Thai food in the US). \u00a0There is also an option for set menu where you choose from a choice of appetizer, a set of seafood or meat mains, and a dessert. \u00a0Actually, the set menu is a nice way to explore various dishes but it is a little pricey at $69 per person. \u00a0The standouts from the set menu included the pork skewers, wagyu beef, and the watercress. \u00a0The durian ice cream still packs a punch, so I preferred the Thai tea ice cream, which was a perfect ending to the meal. \u00a0Also, they have happy hour until 8pm with a selection of $10 cocktails. \u00a0 They all run a bit sweet, but goes well with the food (the bpk is fun - flaming cocktail). \u00a0Service is solid and the servers were quite helpful. \u00a0The dining room is dark, but trendy and with a nice view of the Marina. \u00a0Overall, I enjoyed my visits here. \u00a0It's not quite Nahm, but it does work on its own level. \u00a0Food can be a bit pricey but overall spend was reasonable given happy hour prices for drinks.","771":"I don't often write reviews, but this place just compelled me to. Food was way too salty, and neither:a. \u00a0genuine; norb. \u00a0caucasian-ised such that it was nice for Western palatesCertainly not good value for money either, even by Marina Bay Sands standards","772":"There are many amazing dishes that you almost never find in any Thai restaurant either in or outside the country. But you would find them at stalls in small alleys in Thailand, for no more than 50 Baht per serving. We had several memorable dishes: Miang Kham (dried prawns with ginger, toasted coconut and betel leaves - amazing!); long eggplant and steamed duck egg salad (a break from your usual beef, green mango or papaya salads); sour orange fish curry (a curry without coconut milk); stir-fried squid with chillies, green peppercorn and basil (I wonder how any ang mo could finish such a spicy dish); a Thai char kway teow oozing in multiple flavours! Leave room for the durian ice cream. The main negative about this place is that it is extraordinarily overpriced.","773":"Awesome spot to enjoy appetizers and a view. \u00a0My boyfriend and I stopped here after a day at the Flower Dome. \u00a0Would recommend this place to friends and family!","774":"This is the best Thai food in Singapore. Well, for most of the dishes anyway. I will get out of the way the two that I recommend avoiding: the Padthai (I know! How disappointing to have a miss on the most famous of Thai dishes) and the baked duck. The Padthai was too sweet and the noodles were overly al dente. The baked duck was nothing special. Pretty bland duck that you dip in to sauces to add flavor and the sauces are one note hits too. On to the good! The decor is sooo cool, IMO. The tiles are all imported from Thailand. Lends a Super cool vibe to the restaurant. The bathroom is pretty unique too. You'll just have to go check it out for yourself to see what I mean.The pork and rice cake appetiser is a must try! But you have to love spicy food. It's one of those dishes that takes you on a rollercoaster of regret, acceptance, love and repeat. The heat is intense to say the least. The fried tiger shrimp were simply delicious. Cooked to perfection with a mildly sweet and slightly tangy flavor.They sometimes do an in-house durian ice cream that tasted like a durian fluffy sugar\/milk cloud. And the banana roti cake is a religious experience. (Side note, the first time I had it there they kind of burned it a little and I hated it. The subsequent times it has been cooked to perfection.)Definitely give them a try if you're at mbs and jonesing for some yummy ( but expensive) Thai food.","775":"Best Thai in Singapore. Surprisingly reasonably priced for a celebrity chefs restaurant in MBS. Big surprise here is the amazing bar staff who will create anything you desire, just tell them what you feel like. In terms of the food, expect BIG flavours here, much, much bigger than standard restaurants. You have to try the Chiang Mai Larp starter. My goodness. This little number will blow your head off. Once you get past the Chilli, the taste is phenomenal. It's a roller coaster of death with a pleasant finish (i.e still being alive). If you ask, they occasionally have Beef Massaman, but it's not on the menu. Staples like Pad Thai, Wagyu Beef Skewers are also not to be missed. We love this place and have been about four times. Great with kids, better without. Will be back again soon.","776":"While it may not be a typical street food offering, its interpretation is definitely many notches higher in terms of quality & taste especially the Pad Thai, it's one of the best I've tasted outside Bangkok, I might even say that it holds a class of its own. We especially enjoyed our starter which is:Prawn cakesMains of:Grilled fish, vermicelli with baked prawns, mashed prawn curry & green beef curryAccording to my friend, Thompson's food is an old-school version of Thai food that does not appeal to the young, more modern Thai palate. \u00a0Old school or not, what his team (Thompson does not cook here) are doing at Long Chim is top-notch, and at these prices (around $10 for entrees and $20 and upwards for shared mains), one could hardly do better.Anyway, I think Long Chim is a great addition to Singapore's restaurant scene. \u00a0Thai food in Singapore generally has a bad rep, which I suspect is largely to do with the inability to source the super-fresh produce and other ingredients which make Thai cuisine such a joy. \u00a0Long Chim has made a genuinely impressive start and I hope it will set a new bar for Thai cuisine here.","777":"This place is yet another in the trend of celebrity chef restaurants. The great chef of the hour in this instance is David Thompson, who is an Aussie chef famous for his take on Thai cuisine. He has a couple of restaurants in Sydney, and Nahm is his Michelin star restaurant in Bangkok. With a resume like that, we were expecting a really impressive evening.Location: On the waterfront area, in the Casino\/Mall complex. Great location because you can walk around the park before or after dinner, see the Supertree grove by night, and you'll have a decent view of the Marina Bay during your meal, depending on your table.Decor\/ambience: The place has really beautiful design details in the color scheme, tiles, light fixtures, etc. But it feels mass-manufactured and inauthentic. Like a chain restaurant. Oh wait, it basically is a chain restaurant.Drinks: We had a couple of cocktails each. They are low on alcohol and *very* high on sugar. Despite the interesting ingredients, there's no real craftsmanship in these cocktails.Food: We did the set menu, which is just a selection of items from the regular menu. The chef selects items for your table. I was disappointed with the food because the flavors oscillated between bland and blow-out-your-palate spicy. That being said, we had a couple of starters that were nice, and the mango sticky rice dessert was the best I've ever had.Overall, there was absolutely nothing going on here that isn't done better (and significantly cheaper) at a food stall. The problem with celebrity chef restaurants is that, well, they have the name of the chef but not the chef him\/herself.","778":"Really really yummy. Food: 9\/10 - ordered the prawn cakes, awsome. And for entree hade the sun dried deep fried squid. Such a different taste, really good, and my favorite squid preparation of all time. Drinks- 8\/10 had a Hi Soda, it was crisp and boozy. Service - 10\/10, everyone from the hostess on was nice and smiley. Ambiance - 7\/10- the lighting was 15% too dim, but the place is decorated nicely and all the table items were cool.Price - 7\/10 - a little expensive for the ingredients used, but worth it for the taste. $9 for a bottle of water, idk, haha. I would and want to go back. Really good Thai food.","779":"Want to be at the top of the food chain? Then you gotta have some Shark Meat Lor Mee. Enough said.","780":"Not sure what to expect with this. I knew it works be noodle to some extent.Someone else already mentioned, the shark tastes just like fish. So no reason distinction as it is battered.There actually wasn't a line when I went..just a guy in front of me. Ordering was painless...They give you a bowl of the broth(which I thought would be more fluid but it was kinda thick...Like gelatinous. I shuttle have preferred reg liquid consistency). Then you had your condiments in nearby bowls.If you are doing take away, they wrap each component in separate little bags(noodle, fish..etc)..so when you get home you just dump then into bowl. It was tasty actually but again I would prefer a more liquid broth as the thickness was a bit overwhelming for me.","781":"To get things started, I don't like my food drenched in gravy. Dishes like Lor Mee, Hor Fun and Mee Fun incur my wrath - how can you enjoy the flavours when everything is soaked in thick gravy? Fortunately, Lor Mee 178 was worth the plunge and is probably the only Lor Mee I'll ever eat. (Please stay that way forever.)Here's the breakdown: you get a bowl of noodles in the thick brown gravy but that's not all, you also have fried shark meat, crispy fritter bites and more crunchy stuff topped onto your noodles. That might be what made it for me. The mix of crunchy with flavourful sauce that not too starchy and good noodles that blends with the sauce. I've read very opposing views on this dish, perhaps from people who prefer to more traditional braised variety but I like this adaptation. I will travel just for this one.","782":"It's so damn hard finding good lor mee in Singapore - also, it seems like it no longer is one of those dishes you can easily find at any food court so that makes the search even tougher. So, in light if these circumstances, Lor Mee 178 acts as one of my trusty haunts I fall back on when I just have to get a bowl.The gravy is fantastic - it has good flavour of the stock but isn't overwhelmingly starchy. What I really like about this stall is the shark nuggets! Actually, it iss really just fried fish bits that sound a little more exotic. The crispiness adds a good texture to the dish. Each bowl also comes along with the usual braised egg, pork belly and ngoh hiang.Ask for extra everything - vinegar, garlic paste, chilli sauce. Best way to enjoy this dish is to go over the top.","783":"My absolute favourite stall in Tiong Bahru market, which is saying a lot given that this food centre is teeming with loads of well-known stalls serving up excellent fare.The broth is flavourful and not too thick, and the accompanying fish is delicious. Make sure, however, to throw in shark nuggets for an additional 50 cents. These chewy and tasty morsels really propel the dish to giddying heights.I usually go a little crazy with the condiments, generously adding vinegar, garlic paste and chilli to the mix... but isn't that how lor mee is best enjoyed? Definitely a must-try, and easily a destination for those looking out for the best lor mee stalls in Singapore.","784":"Lor Mee that kicks ass but might not get you kisses.Tiong Bahru market, another food paradise of Singaporean delights.What to eat? Obviously, you're not one who's keen on wasting tummy space... if not you wouldn't be reading a review.Well, Jonny boy is here to help. Do you like Lor mee? If so, Don't waste time. Order from this stall. Served with deep fried shark meat and super crunchy flour crumbs, this Lor mee is heavenly. Gravy that's thick and full of tasty vinegary goodness. The shark meat (I don't take shark's fin's soup because of the cruel ways they 'hunt' for these but I figure if they used the whole shark, there's no issue) is deep fried and it kinda reminds me of fish and chips, without the chips.You are given free reign of garnishes so I recommend piling on the freshly cut chilli and lots of garlic. Your breath will smell for at least two hours (non garlic eaters would never kiss you) but it's worth it. Corporate rats be sure to confirm that you have no client meetings after your meal! Unless you get them to go with you for the Lor Mee.","785":"When a hawker stall has a long queue, join in. Even if it does not turned out to be super delicious, it won't be too bad either. \u00a0Fortunately, the Lor Mee($2.50) falls into the first category. Perhaps what draws regular crowd is the Shark Meat Fritters (add 50cents) and the braised gravy. Mix all the chilli sauce, grated ginger, vinegar, gravy, some crunchy stuff together with the noodles and you'll get a simple, comforting bowl of Lor Mee minus the braised egg and ngor hiong.","786":"Obviously Shark meat isnt the most common ingredient you'd find being sold in a dish. In fact, almost never. But the shark meat lor mee is actually quite nice. The shark meat is coated in a light batter and fried into crispy nuggets. When you bite into it, the meat is tender and you can taste the freshness of the shark meat. It goes very well with the thick lor mee gravy and yellow noodles.","787":"Given the popularity of sharks fin soup in Asia, I find it curious that we don't see more restaurants selling sharks meat. Sharks meat is what gives this veteran of Tiong Bahru market its uniqueness. It serves a mean bowl of lor mee for $2.50 - for an additional $0.50 they'll toss in a few pieces of fried sharks meat in your bowl. Like fish fritters, it tastes awesome when eaten crispy, especially when it is soaked in starchy lor mee sauce to give it that delightful balance of crunchy soupiness. While the fritters themselves were well fried, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the sharks meat and normal fish, though. Having this exotic dish already also means the stall could scrimp on more traditional accompaniments to lor mee - I couldn't find many pieces of egg, or ngoh hiong in my bowl of noodles, which, if not for the sharks meat, was nothing spectacular. Still worth visiting though, if only to check it off your list of must-tries in Singapore.","788":"Have not been here for a couple years and the standard of the food is just as good. We ordered their signature appetizer platter with an assortment of Foie Gras on a fresh slice of watermelon, Peking duck with garden salad and wasabi prawn. The small bite size portion is a great way to sample their different dishes without over ordering.We had the shark's fin cooked in shark's bone broth and the soup tasted amazing, and the sharks fin tasted savory and fantastic.We completed the meal with a plate of fried Ee-Fu noodles fried with mushrooms with a speckle of mentaiko. An overall satisfying meal except for the lack of waiters.","789":"This is the worst food that I have ever had in my entire trip. The hotel lobby is nicely decorated with bright complementary style and the restaurant is a mixture with the modern element with a touch of Asia.The restaurant is tiny.We were here for a friend's birthday party and they placed us in this small claustrophobic ivory room. The service is unprofessional and our waitress have this lukewarm smile on her face all the time.We had Majestic degustation menu.--+ Crispy prawn is soggy and bland, it has nothing much to do with salty egg yolk, because it tasted like yesterday's fried shrimp. Seared foie gras on the water melon is the most gross foie gras that I ever had in my entire life. The liver tasted bitter and it has a urine smell. \u00a0There is this strange flour coating on the liver. It didn't taste seared, but fried. \u00a0However the 2,50 inch crispy skin of Peking duck is the best dish of the entire menu. ---Sharkfin soup with the crab meat. \u00a0The sharkfin soup is bland and the crab meat is tiny. \u00a0---Poached sliced Wagyu beef with bean sprouts in soya sauce. Sliced beef were chewy and tasteless, bean sprouts isn't crisp and the overly salted soya sauce is over powering the whole dish.---Braised abalone and homemade bean curd. Bean curd didn't tasted homemade and it wasn't fresh. Abalone tasted like those from the can section. The whole dish was fishy. ---Steamed trio xiao long bao looked like tiny vacuum packages. Dough is flattened and soggy. \u00a0 I can't taste what is different in between foie gras, black truffle or crab roe. Everything is bland. I took a bite on each one and left there. ---Stewed mee sua with Oyster was gross. The oyster were tiny, sandy and fishy. Mee sua tasted like dried noodles from any supermarket and the broth is tasteless. -++Crispy durian ice cream looks nicely fried and it was the most edible dish in the whole set. Our waitress who smiles like she's having tooth pain was serving us the wrong dish but she seemed like she doesn't want to serve us the right dish \" Do you still want your dish? Because we just served you the wrong dish.\" Singapore is \u00a0like foodie heaven, save your money and go somewhere else.","790":"Great food. Peking duckBamboo clamGolden shrimpChefs choice soupBak Choy Duck noodles10 years Chinese wine Assorted fruits","791":"We've been to this place at least 3 times and each time have walked away very happy and satisfied, and I look forward to going back again.The wasabi prawns are truly remarkably delicious - so much so that I'm struggling to recall the other things we like to go with it. \u00a0The salt cod fried rice is also a winner and \u00a0a staple on our short list. \u00a0Delicious with a cold Tsing Tao.The topper offer is the durian ice cream fritter. \u00a0It is ridiculously rich, and before you wrinkle your nose, this is worth opening your mind (and piehole) for. \u00a0Rich durian ice cream comes inside a deep fried fritter - mixing hot and cold. \u00a0The flavor has a creamy flavor with an oniony bite. \u00a0And, yes, it tastes better than it smells (although there is very little smell from the ice cream.) \u00a0Must try.","792":"Located in Majestic Hotel, Majestic Restaurant serves modern Chinese and is one of the more popular restaurants for business lunches and dinners.Food : We loved the combination platter of crispy wasabi prawn, peking duck andpan-seared foie gras. The shark's bone soup with fish maw and beijing cabbage was rich and nourishing and we also really liked the pan seared cod fish and pan-seared fillet of rib eye with sesame sauce. The chilled mango pudding with black glutinous rice was an interesting play on flavours and texture.Ambience : PleasantService : Excellent","793":"We had a post work day dinner at the Majestic with a fixed menu. \u00a0Every item was wonderful. \u00a0Especially tasty was the sliced peking duck and a combination dish of bean curd skin rolled with foie gras, chili crabmeat and three lychee skew mai.","794":"Man Fu YuanIntercontinental HotelHaven't been here for years. Smoked duck - niceLychee stuffed with scallop coated with salted egg yolk and almond slicesScallop with kai lan and dried scallop- very niceCrab fried rice - certainly better than that soggy fried rice at Greyhound SingaporeSweet potato balls with custard insideRed bean sesame pancake - very niceVery reasonable prices.","795":"Dinner: Came in for dinner on a weekday and the place was pretty crowded with large groups celebrating the Chinese New Year to come. There was a special Chinese New Year menu but she explained they are willing to do a lot of different dishes that may not appear on the menu. But no dumplings at dinner time. We ordered off the menu: a half roasted duck on the advice of a co-worker, Ong Choy with garlic sauce, Fried Rice, and Fried Prawns with Passion Fruit. The duck and shrimp I would absolutely get again. The rice was ok and the Ong Choy kept me from feeling guilty since it was a vegetable! It was all so good I went back the next day for lunch and dumplings!Lunch: \u00a0We ordered Shrimp Dumplings, Pork dumplings (spicy), Pork buns, Egg tarts, Deep fried shredded yam, and a Suckling pig and meat combination which consisted of pig, duck and shoua chicken. \u00a0Wow! Everything was excellent. This was one of my favorite places and best dim sum. Next time, I'd skip the yam so I could eat more egg tarts :)","796":"Ma Fu Yuan (?????) is a chinese, specifically Cantonese restaurant located at Intercontinental Hotel Singapore.My brother made a reservation for us today for dim sum. I do not remember if I had dined here before. I have definitely stayed in this hotel as well as had afternoon high tea here at their lobby lounge eons ago. My memory is getting fuzzy in recent times, I might have eaten in this chinese restaurant but anyhow that would be a long long time ago. So this review is the same like heading to an establishment which I do not know much about, not sure what to expect especially when the restaurant has a current standing of 3.5 stars on yelp. Not a good sign :(Oh well, I did tell myself if the lunch turned out to be bad, I can blame it on my brother, hehe even though I love my little brother very much.So how was the lunch? This restaurant definitely deserves more then a 3.5 stars. I am giving it a 4. The staffs were all very attentive. Service was top notch. The staffs even went and returned with tiny chairs so that some of us could sit comfortably with purses next to our plush chairs. Service would definitely earn this restaurant a \u00a05 stars but how about the food. Let's see..Prawn & mango roll - A+ Definitely my favorite! It's crispy on the outside, prawns and mango were fresh)duck meat spring roll with yam - B+ The combination was rather odd to me. My brother likes it though but since I am the one writing this review, this will be a B+ dishPrawn dumplings - A. A dish no respectable restaurant in Singapore should messed up. Prawns were fresh and dumpling skin thin and soft (what a good dumpling should always be. Minced pork dumplings with scallops - A. Like the prawn dumplings, they were good, as expected. Rice roll with BBQ meat and coriander - A+ This would be my #2 favorite dish. The meat was so tender, the rice roll was so soft. The coriander brought everything together. It cost a little more than other dishes but totally worth it.Honey glazed BBQ pork buns - A. The buns were fluffy, the meat inside was savory. Maybe my expectation is too high, or simply, if any decent Cantonese restaurant cannot produce good bbq pork buns, they should close the restaurant and maybe sell shoes. Why shoes? Errr.. I don't know. Perhaps, shoes just go by sizes and perhaps width too. Ok, my jet lag is still lingering, can't think properly but any smart person will understand what I am trying to say here.Yam Croquette - A. They were good, but not enough to make me want to return and order the same.Chilled Mango Sago with Pomelo - C. Usually a dessert at the end of any meal would made me very happy, just not this one. The dessert had too much sugar in it, not much mango pur\u00e9e. I declared at the table I could make this at home and taste a whole lot better, that would just mean this dessert completely failed. I still could not understand why the dessert turned up to be so disappointing.I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and that was the reason why I took off one star here.","797":"Food was alright. Had the Dim sum buffet on a Saturday. The service was average and the food was served extremely slowly. Imagine a Chinese wedding lunch, with no entertainment. Worst dim sum buffet experience ever","798":"Man Fu Yuan is one of Singapore's finest Chinese restaurants, serving classic Cantonese cuisine created especially for the restaurant by a Hong Kong Master Chef. From now till 31 May 2014, Man Fu Yuan is serving some glorious dishes from the good old days, made using good quality ingredients and special and laborious techniques. Now here are some favorites from the Nostalgic Menu. The flavourful Mixed Beef Stew with handmade beef balls ????? ($28 per portion). I love how the meat is tender and savory. The beef balls were succulent and had nice chunks of water chestnut in them. This is the perfect comfort food.Tea-smoked Pork Belly Char Siew ???? ($24 per portion) takes centre stage, featuring pork belly marinated in a combination of Chinese rose wine and barbecue sauce. It's fatty and decadent but hey YOLO. I loved the Hong Kong Style Steamed Pork Belly in Shrimp Paste ???????? ($28 per portion). This is another comfort dish and i can fully identify with the flavors though i've never had this dish before. Salty, stinky and oh damn delicious. Give me another 2 bowls of rice.Pig Trotters with Vinegar ??? \u00a0($28 per portion). The meat was well braised in plum vinegar and you can smell the sour perfume from far. The dish is on the oily side though. Ended dinner with some Hashima. It typically comes served in a coconut but Chef wasn't too pleased with the coconut that day.If you find these flavors familiar and are craving for it now, Man Fu Yuan's A Taste of Nostalgia Menu will be available as part of a rotating a la carte menu available daily till 31 May 2014. Do call the restaurant to find out if they'll be serving your favorite dish before heading down!","799":"This is a review of a dinner with a friend at Man Fu Yuan.tinyurl.com\/n39t5y2The ambiance is that of a classic traditional Chinese fine dining restaurant. \u00a0It is conservative and restrained with its fair share of large white tablecloth covered tables. \u00a0It is a little hidden away on the second floor of the Intercontinental Hotel.tinyurl.com\/lnpledjThe staff was relatively friendly but they were not helpful. \u00a0They were unable to answer questions about the rather sizable menu. \u00a0They were unable to make suggestions. \u00a0They were unable to answer questions concerning the wine list. \u00a0The food ranged from mediocre to good. \u00a0However, there wasn't any dish that was particularly outstanding. \u00a0Dinner Collage:tinyurl.com\/lncgdjxDim sum - Out of the dumplings we tried, I would have to say their \"special\" dumpling was the one that stood out the most. \u00a0The other dumplings were good but in a city that boasts a tremendous amount of fantastic dim sum none of these stood out. \u00a0These included shrimp dumplings and vegetable dumplings.tinyurl.com\/krkp7lgtinyurl.com\/l7lggovtinyurl.com\/klz2fhbPerch - I did not enjoy this dish. \u00a0I thought the flavour of the fish was too strong. \u00a0Plus, for some reason, the sauce was separating in a most unappetizing way.tinyurl.com\/mr45vlqSpicy kai-lan - For me, this dish was very difficult to eat. \u00a0It was extremely tough. \u00a0There was also still a significant bitterness to the greens. \u00a0 It was also milder than I expected.tinyurl.com\/nyyh7bcChili Crab Dish - They offered a simplified version of chili crab. \u00a0This was basically just the crab meat. \u00a0However, it was overly sweet and lacked any real heat.tinyurl.com\/m7kz2dmPrice - My friend picked up the tab. \u00a0I do not know the overall cost. \u00a0However, this is a relatively expensive restaurant.Overall - The ambiance is quite nice. \u00a0 The staff was friendly but not well prepared. \u00a0 The food trended towards mediocre. \u00a0For this cuisine, there are far better options in Singapore.","800":"Man Fu Yuan, which means \"Garden of Prosperity,\" is one of Singapore's finest Chinese restaurants, serving classic Cantonese cuisine. It is a perfect place to impress both your business associates as well as your grandparents.Food : We really liked the trio of dim sum, which showcased both traditional handcrafted dim sum and novelty items with a twist. The old school \"hum sui kok\" (deep-fried glutinous rice dumplings filled with meat) were delightful golden parcels that were both chewy and soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. The chilli crab tart removes the hassle of eating the popular crustacean dish by encasing its meat in buttery pastry crust, while the scallop rice roll is presented in a deliciously deconstructed manner.One of Man Fu Yuan's signature dishes is the stewed noodles with lobster, with good reason. Steeped in a flavoursome stock made from lobster, clams, and mussels, the al dente rice noodles are a perfect accompaniment to the juicy chunks of lobster stir-fried with ginger and spring onion. Another favourite would be the deep-fried salted egg yolk buns - the best we have ever tasted! Imagine biting into a deep fried mantou (bread) and having hot salted egg yolk oozing out like lava and filling your mouth. We were at a lost for words.By the time dessert came around, we were stuffed, but we absolutely couldn't resist the tantalizing hue of golden orange calling our names. The cream of Japanese pumpkin topped with coconut ice cream and black glutinous rice was surprisingly light yet velvety, providing a wonderful finish to our meal.Ambience : Great for business lunches with its blend of modern and traditional Peranakan touches.Service : Excellent!","801":"proper good cantonese cooking at this old hotel standby in bugis. this place used to be a family favorite (we're talking more than five or six years ago) - and then they switched chefs, standards dropped, and there was that case of food poisoning on the news - all of which meant we stopped coming here.but we decided to give it a go recently - and I can't be more pleased to tell you that the food is as good as it used to be, and it deserves its reputation as a cantonese stronghold reinstated.the thing about these grand hotel-located chinese restaurants (such as summer pavilion), is that they are judged against a more stringent yardstick - and allowed to charge higher prices for fulfilling that potential. so when they're good, as in this case, it really is some fantastic cooking.we started off with a bowl of winter melon soup each - intensely-flavored consomme with a round of melon, crunchy prawns and bits of scallops. we always order this when we come here, though it used to be served as an entire small gourd with soup within - this is a smaller serve, but beautifully done all the same.our mains started with a plate of sweet-and-sour monkey head mushroom: decent, and I suspect would have been impressive if we don't often order a better rendition at lingzhi (where the larger cuts of mushroom have a meatier texture).we were blown away by the sauteed beef with garlic chips though - so tender, and beefy, and that black pepper sauce just coating the cubes (without any of that gross gloppiness).these were followed by a claypot of braised beancurd sheets and vegetables - I love vegetables anyway, but these were tender and more savory than you'd associate with meatlessness.a plate of chicken steamed with wood's ear and salty fermented beancurd was undoubtedly homey - and rather anaemic on the plate apart from that bright garnish - but delicious all the same.a couple of us finished with dessert - hashima served hot in a coconut shell, as well as a bowl of cheery pumpkin served with black glutinous rice and ice-cream.good food doesn't lend itself to much description - this place serves as up expert cantonese food, and its always-posh decor makes it great for bringing the parents or impressing guests.","802":"Very had the black pepper beef and chili chicken. \u00a0 Have to say I wasn't all that thrilled with chicken but the beef was outstanding, couldn't get enough. \u00a0 For a starter we had the pork and duck. \u00a0Both were a great way to get it started. \u00a0 It was the only night we stayed and ate in the hotel and we weren't disappointed.","803":"First timer at Man Fu and the food & service were fantastic and the decor exudes high standards. \u00a0Truly enjoyed the food and service they were on top of everything when it came to our needs. \u00a0Would definitely recommend coming and experiencing everything they offer as you won't be disappointed.","804":"The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Grand Hyatt hotel. We had a group business dinner in the wine room, which is an experience in itself. You are sitting next to all of the first growth Bordeaux (Margaux, Latour, Lafite, Mouton Rothschild), lots of second growth, also DRC, Gaja and more - truly creates a special mood for the wine lovers. We had dinner family style - excellent crab cakes, chicken wings, a couple of salads, followed by steak, pan-fried chicken and salmon with French fries, Brussels sprouts and a few other side dishes. Dessert included a number of different sorbet, ice creams and more.Excellent service, both dinner, and wine.I definitely recommend the restaurant, but probably having an expense account would be a significant plus.","805":"Review for soft launch of Beyond Burger:Day 1:How was the plant based Beyond burger? Yes, it was good for the novelty. I love food trucks and love the vibe here, but for $10, seems like they only cooked the patty and bun.... As a meat lover, this was overall ok. I was very surprised by how half the burger felt warm and the other cold. The patty, when eaten alone, didn't have much taste. The sauce, however, went well with the patty. Texture and color was also not close enough to beef. It had ok chewiness but not what I wanted in a beef patty, not dense enough? Color was very very red as well. Also, the veggies were not cooked so the onions were too raw for me. the veggies made the patty cold too quickly. And the cheese was mild in flavor and kept breaking into small pieces. Melted cheese in a burger please!!!! Day 2:Get the classic! The Asian don't need to bother. The sauce was a dry paste so it didn't really cover the patty. Didn't taste wasabi or siracha mayo. The patty still has a funky aftertaste, definitely did not fool me to think it was meat. The slaw had not much taste, should be pickled for more flavor. The burger was much smaller than the classic. Sorry my dear friends who I've misled to try the Asian. For those who try tomorrow, go for the classic! At least the cold veggies problem is solved. Overall the beyond burger patty had good chewiness but was very dry. You need a good vehicle of melted cheese and lots of flavorful sauce to enhance the experience. Personally, it doesn't satisfy my meat craving, nor was it better than veggie patties I get from Trader Joe's or the classic Indonesian seitan. P.S. the burger shrank from day 1. I can eat 1.5 of them or even 2. Went with my friends for dinner round 2 cos it was just not satisfying. And everyone was so desperate for a drink, why? There's not supposed to be any MSG in the patty!!! \u00a0Food truck ends 8pm on 18 Aug. beyond burgers will be going for $25 from Monday at the Mezza9. #futureofprotein #futureoffood #grandhyattsg #mezza9 #plantbasedburger #alternativeprotein #drklingeats #istillprefermeat #mockmeat2.0 #wheredoesyourfoodcomefrom #grandhyattsg #mezza9sg","806":"I took the long hike to meet friends here having started off at the Martini Bar for happy hour drinks first. The food was delicious and much needed to soak up the preceding wine and cocktails. I was surprised at how expensive the oysters were, but this is Singapore after all. Food was faultless and on cue. The salmon and greens were cooked to perfection. I loved the open-planned kitchen and of course, the Penfolds wine display! I think I tried some wine too, though this was nudging me closer to my threshold for the night. Dessert was gorgeous and I left well and truly filled and sated.","807":"I went for their lunch sets because with your UOB card, there's a 1-for-1 deal. (It's specific to the card type I think, you should check before heading there.) For a fairly reasonable price, you can indulge in a 3 course meal at lunch with coffee\/tea thrown in at the end!The bread they served was pretty good - possibly a ciabatta, with a roasted capsicum\/pepper dip. I had the sashimi salad, market roasted fish, and tart of the day. The sashimi salad was alright - it was a little too salty from the amount of soy sauce they dumped on it but was otherwise very generous with the raw fish. The market roasted fish was beautifully cooked but was extremely tiny! Just one slice of fish (I had snapper when I was there) with a couple of vegetables. I originally intended to just have 2 courses but it was so small, I was forced to order dessert. The day I was at Mezza9, their tart of the day was pear. While the ice cream served with it was dismal (strange vanilla flavor, creamy but eh), the tart was actually pretty good. The pastry was nice and crumbly, and it wasn't too sweet overall.I'd go back for their 1 for 1 deal, but otherwise don't really see the point of spending all that money here.","808":"The champagne brunch on Sundays is fabulous! Definitely book in advance - every table was full. It was $125\/person with tax & service charge, which sounds crazy but it is worth every penny. This includes unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne, which they top up every time you take a couple sips. You could also have bloody marys, mojitos, red or white wine. I'm usually not a fan of buffets as the food doesn't tend to be the best quality, but this one is different - top-notch food that was constantly refreshed. While vegetarians will have less selection than meat eaters, there is definitely more than ample food for everyone's tastes. The buffets included a raw bar of crab claws, oysters, even caviar. The cheese table was exceptional - high quality cheese with accompaniments like quince or honey fresh from the honeycomb. There was a Japanese section with many types of sushi & sashimi (including vegetarian). There was a Chinese\/Malay section with dim sum buns, meat on a stick, and many different seafood stir frys. The roast section had many options including wagyu beef sliders. The roasted vegetable sides were also plentiful. You could have eggs made to order. Plus there was a salad bar. And the dessert table went on for days!We sat for 3 hours enjoying countless glasses of champagne and leisurely working our way through all the stations. It was definitely a treat! (And you wont need to eat for the rest of the day)","809":"Strawberry cheesecake ($58\/kg) - 5 starsThis is my perfect cheesecake. Not too creamy, it has a bite to it that has the perfect amount of firmness. It's also not so rich that you feel sick eating it, but solid enough that I wouldn't have more than a slice.Blackforest cake ($58\/kg) - 5 starsAnother perennial favourite in my family. I've been recommended places like Stuttgart Blackforest Boutique S-Caf\u00e9 but have found most blackforest cakes filled with way too much whipped cream (worse still when it's cheap greasy whipped cream). This one is just divine.","810":"The main advantage of this place, which has a vibrant atmosphere, is if people in your party have different culinary preferences, they would probably find what they want here. Otherwise, the food is not as good as what you would find at the equivalent specialist restaurant - whether it is grill, sushi, Thai, Chinese, etc. Service keeps deteriorating; at our last visit, it was downright horrific: One waiter spilled hot water and did not clean the table until requested to do so; another waiter dropped a whole bowl of boiling soup and only provided ice cubes for our guest to cool herself when asked; drinks (iced tea, Diet Coke) came after 20 minutes, a glass of wine never came (in spite of a volunteered promise that it would be free)!! The table was left uncleaned for a long time. At the premium price charged, customers deserve better.","811":"The Mezza9 restaurant is a top choice in Singapore. It's not a buffet m restaurant, but they still deliver variety like no other restaurant I know. I love the fact that you have Thai, Chinese, Japanese, grill, seafood++ all at the same restaurant!I believe they have 6 or 7 kitchens. Food recommendations:-lobster bisque -pork skewers-crab cake++","812":"It's three stars for the food which ranged from stale table bread to fantastic lamb chop. \u00a0Presentation was excellent but the flavor hits and misses make it a bit of lottery dining here, depending on what you order. Service was a lot like the food. \u00a0Unfortunately our table was served by a generally absent waiter who saw it fit to educate us on the different types of coffee (eg what is a latte!) we can add to our dinner, which the other server had wrongly told us was included in our dinner set. \u00a0All in, \u00a0I was reminded why this is not a go to place for me.","813":"So I made a new friend on Korean Air flight to Singapore.Apparently he was loaded, owning three factories around the world and wanted to treat me and my boyfriend for something special and invited us to this restaurant as he was staying at the hotel.I don't even remember the names of all the food we had but they were nothing like I had eaten before. Soooooo goooood! Foods from every corner of the world, it felt like. The presentation and also the taste. Singaporeans are quite good at making the food looking good. The place was looking fabulous and classy.I tried my first durian here.","814":"I went here for a Sunday brunch and it was quite crowded, many foreigners and many large groups. This is a great place for many types of diners and the restaurant is so large you can easily enjoy a quiet intimate corner for two, a private dining room for a large family, a big round table for a couple of families or any other type of diner.A real drawback, and perhaps it was just for this brunch, but they seem to have squeezed tables into every possible space and even places they shouldn't have, so you were often having to wait to walk through narrow walkways or trying not to bump seated guests while getting around someone getting food. I even saw a table setup at the hostess stand in the front.A big selling point for us was their family friendly atmosphere and they did not disappoint in this area. They have taken one of the above mentioned private dining rooms and turned it into a kids \"camp\" staffed with at least three \"Counselors\" who do a great job interacting with toddlers to teens. This is a free service that allows the adults to relax, talk, enjoy their meals and try many of the different selections. And there are many different types of food to choose from, I've been told that the 9 in their name refers to the nine different kitchens. There is Sushi, Yakitori, general asian, western, seafood, dessert and others I probably missed. Because of their show kitchen concept this isn't a buffet where the food questionably comes out in chafing dishes prepared in the back; this is food being prepared right in front of you and then often being refreshed into the serving dishes as you are taking. The food preparation doesn't get much fresher, especially for a buffet.I think almost everyone should be able to find something to eat, although I didn't see an Indian section or dedicated vegetarian food; and there wasn't a traditional western breakfast items at this brunch, egg station etc...None of us took part in the champagne part of the brunch, but there were bottles popping everywhere and I saw many other drinks, wine, beer and cocktails going by; and they gave us free flow of coffee and soft drinks as well. Often you ask at a buffet for a beer or a soda and you're told it isn't included, it looks like they will serve you any drink you ask for, and your bill will only reflect alcohol or not.Speaking of the bill it is very expensive to dine here, over $135 without alcohol. This wouldn't be a regular weekend activity but for a group with kids this is a great place to get together for a special occasion.","815":"Absolutely the best place to go for Martini in Singapore! \u00a0They have a huge range of martini on their menu and other drinks too. Their Happy Hours is from 6-9pm, Mondays to Saturdays. \u00a0It's always packed so you'll have to go early to get a seat. \u00a0Otherwise you'll have to stand around. \u00a0Very busy service staff and very friendly and helpful. \u00a0I've tried their classic, chocolate and lychee martini. \u00a0All great!","816":"The only addition I would make to my previous review is to add that the service here from every member of staff is simply wonderful. It is arguably the best service in Singapore.","817":"You can be certain that the team at Mezza9 takes their desserts seriously when you discover an exquisite menu devoted wholeheartedly to desserts. Since September last year, this menu featuring five desserts and a cheese platter, has been introduced and adds on to the existing cakes\/pastries at the Mezza9 shop. What's better way to indulge in their DESSERT PLATTER ($32++) that offers a taste of everything after a satisfying Italian dinner at Pete's Place! Does this look like a hot piping Souffle? In fact, this is a frozen Grand Marnier Souffle \u00a0that is no less potent than the bottle of liquor itself. Every spoonful oozed plenty of boozy goodness that I constantly reminded myself to handle this with extra care to minimize spillage. Much has been raved about the astoundingly creamy home-made ice cream and this mixed pool is no exception. The smooth, rich Papua New Guinea vanilla bean and Manjaro chocolate ice cream sat in contrast with the eye-poppingly tart Passionfruit sherbet and zesty raspberry sherbet, creating quite an exciting taste experience that would appease gelato and sherbet fans at the same time. There is a bonus that is not as showy as the curvy nut tuile perched at the top--bitter cacao nibs inside the intense chocolate gelato. Mezza 9 Deconstructed Pavlova ($16++ for ala carte) The cloud-like crispy baked meringues were taken down a notch on sweetness with the sourish kick from the sherbet and berries. Dessert flower pots are no longer any novelty but the Flower Pot ($16++ for ala carte) here is probably one of the better ones in town. It is not spammed with mousse or any cheese cake but a superbly executed caramel sea salt ice cream that enrobed the palates with toasty notes of burnt sugar. To be more precise, the caramel flavour was perfect, something that very few can mastered well (most are either overdone or underdone). Besides the flower pot, the Grand Cru Chocolate Mousse ($16++ ala carte) is my another favourite in this platter. After all the bright flavours, this chocolate jar proved to be a pleasantly bitter sanctuary that soothes the taste buds. I emptied the entire shooter of dark chocolate sauce and sank myself in the blissful chocolate bed.  A divine finish for the divine desserts","818":"one of my favorite restaurants around. impeccable service along with great food.i love how consistent they are with e service. been here many times and without fail, im always greeted with a smile when i walk in. e attentiveness throughout e whole meal with e wait staff or manager coming around asking how's e food, makes you feel you matter.1. complimentary bread + diplove how e bread is served warm and homemade dip is yummy and makes you wanting for more.2. yu sheng (during festive \"lunar new year\" only)one of e nicer yu sheng i had so far. its served with salmon and kingfisher fish. you can opt for more condiments with extra cost. having e wait staff saying e good wishes for e yusheng in english seems kind of odd but have to give it to them for effort.3. boston lobster eefuu noodle \/ crispy noodlemy fav dish when im here but seems to be better last time. e one i had that day was kinda bland. this is good for 2-3 to share4. soon hock crispy fishso good you can eat it on its own. fried to perfection. wish i had this at home so i can chew up e whole plate together with e bones. omnomnom factor 10\/105. fried nian gao with coconut sherbetthey have this every year during lunar new year! this time i feel it was fried with too much egg but still good nonetheless. \u00a0e nian gao and coconut sherbet goes v well together.easter egg for y'all who is reading this review. e deli have e best double chocolate chip cookie i ever had. thumbs up.","819":"I completely do not get the previous reviews of this restaurant. Conveniently located in the Hyatt hotel, this restaurant, while elegant in decor, does nothing much to dissuade me from my prejudice against hotel restaurants. I sat at the chef's bar, which certainly has its own unique level of ambiance. However, the service was very inattentive, nothing close to the reception one should receive when paying these kinds of prices for food in Singapore. I'm fully willing to concede that this lack of service was primarily due to me sitting at the chef's bar and being by myself, but that doesn't entice me to ever return. In terms of the food, I had the grilled fish market selection of the day, which was a tuna steak. Nothing to write home about - not bad, but not anywhere close to the best I've had. This is served a la carte style, so I also ordered the Chinese broccoli to accompany. Again, decent but not great. The best part of the meal was the glass of Pinot. Excellent choice there.","820":"Been here on two occasions - but let's start with the food. Normally, the gauge of a good restaurant is how dedicated they are to the number of items on their menu - the fewer, the more concentrated their efforts are to perfecting them - but prepare to spend a good 10 minutes deciding on what you want - they cover all the meats - steak, whole chickens, all kinds of fish, pork, seafood, on the grill, raw, stewed, steamed, fried, blanched, in all forms, shapes, sizes, Asian, Western, or an amalgamation of all the above! Went for the Irish Organic Salmon, fennel, lemon confit 200g ($38) with a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic (+$9), and MAN did it pack a punch! The salmon was cooked perfectly to my liking - just slightly orange on the outside and rare and succelent on the inside, so it wouldn't flake to the touch of a fork, and the spinach was gut-wrenchingly beautifully done - so tasty, that a gourmet Popeye would have his eyes popping out just at the smell of it.The selection of wines were also very seductive - from all regions, the obscure ones, the famous ones, the celebrity ones (that can go above $500 a bottle!), Argentinian, Chilean, imported from Bordeau... if you're looking to please someone who's extremely fickle at menus (and you're not sure if a certain place will be the right fit), Mezza9 has all the right things (giving you all the right reasons!) to come here. Did I mention that the restaurant is humungous and the furniture and furnishings, perfect? This is too much for me. Too perfect. :-)","821":"Very consistent bar, food, desserts. Basically that sums it up.I've been visiting Mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt for a few years already but just recently I though again what good concept they have and how a good kitchen and quality management can make all the difference.Service is usually pretty good as well and I never had an issue getting a table here.What I like in particular is that you can order all different varieties of food and not just one particular cuisine. Sometimes you just want to mix and mingle your dinner options...Good spot!","822":"I don't usually eat at hotel restaurants while on vacation however Mezza9 became my go-to spot. \u00a0The service is punctual and there were a ton of staff. \u00a0Unfortunately there was a bit of a language barrier at times. \u00a0The restaurant encompasses a huge open space with open kitchens which creates an interesting energetic atmosphere.The menu is mostly a selection of Chinese, Japanese and Thai favorites with a smattering of western items. \u00a0I gravitated toward the Thai menu after hearing one of the chefs is Thai and had probably one of the best beef salads and tom yam kungs I have had anywhere. \u00a0Amazingly fresh and flavorful with unmistakeably high quality ingredients.The only downside to Mezza9 is I left Singapore broke.A safe choice if you are in the mood for spending a relaxing night at the hotel, but obviously not the most exciting restaurant in a great city known for an amazing food scene.","823":"Sunday brunch at $138 per person, if you elect not to consume unlimited alcohol, or $168 if you do, provided a fabulous spread, but it's not worth the price. The decor is older, the atmosphere is hotel restaurant and the tables are so close together you find yourself tripping over people both seated and dishing at the serving stations. The food is fresh and cooked pretty much before your very eyes, the various open kitchens provide you with a show of sorts and the children's area is staffed and perfect in allowing parents the ability to enjoy their meal. I started with the raw bar and ate my way through oysters on the half shell and steamed shrimp. I did need a small bath after shelling the shrimp. Sushi was next and, while it was good, it wasn't particularly fresh or imaginative. The \"Western\" beef was rare and delicious while the lamb was cold and filled with fat. The mashed potatoes were excellent along with the green beans. No carrot cake (my absolute favorite) and the pecan tart was okay, but nothing more. I also enjoyed some delicious cheeses. It was a nice experience, but not one I'd sign up for very often. With four more of these \"hotel Sunday brunch\" places in Singapore, I'll need to shop around for a better experience.","824":"Mezza 9 is the restaurant in the mezzanine of the Hyatt Hotel. It's a beautiful open kitchen concept with chefs cooking right in front of you. There is Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine, served mostly family style. The service here is very good and the food is great as well. My favorite thing here though, would have to be their dessert. Try the dessert sampler for two (which is really more like for 4?) which is a platter of about six different types of desserts. Make sure to leave room for this! The restaurant also has a small shop that sells truffles, some pastries and cakes and kitchen and home wear. Check out the attached Martini Bar which serves some of the best martinis in Singapore.","825":"Min Jiang is a great place to come for dim sum, with a relaxing view of the Goodwood Park Hotel swimming pool. I come with my family several times a year and we've always had a great time here. We come for the a la carte dim sum during lunch on weekends. The restaurant usually asks that you leave before 3pm, which is when they start serving a high tea dim sum buffet.I've never tried the buffet as I heard that the standard is not as good when compared to a la carte. I suppose if you're not very fussy and don't mind walking to the buffet table to help yourself, then the buffet will suit you fine. Otherwise, the a la carte dim sum is served to you by staff rolling around the carts. Dim sum here is very fresh and not as expensive as you might think it is. I especially like the steamed scallop dumplings, siew mai and fried prawn dumplings. For dessert, try the mango sago.","826":"In the Goodwood Park hotel off of Scott's... Ok, it's Chinese food - what's exciting is that it's good and the setting next to the pool is pleasant. \u00a0Started with the crispy rice - beautiful broth with succulent chunks if scallops, white fish, and shrimp. \u00a0Then on to the roasted chicken with slivered almonds paired with the \"four treasures\" vegetables. \u00a0There was only two of us but this could of easily fed a family of four. \u00a0The roast chicken was lovely - nice crispy skin, moist chicken and the slivered almonds are an abundant delight mixed with just the right herbs! \u00a0The four treasures were broccoli, asparagus, Chinese broccoli and mushrooms - treasures for sure. \u00a0Felt like authentic main land service - adequate but making you want a bit more. \u00a0Definitely going back. \u00a0If you don't want al fresco you'll want to make reservations.","827":"Specialising in classic Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine, Min Jiang's food is conservative but not tedious. It's an oldie but evergreen goodie, where you'd go to for comforting familiar fare.We ate:1) Prosperity Abalone Lo Hei ($78 for small): nuanced and balanced. Not too sweet, just the way I like it. We supplemented with Crispy Salmon Skin ($22)2) Crabmeat Tofu ($44): Min Jiang uses fresh crabmeat, thankfully, instead of frozen meat. Loved the gravy. 4) Roasted Peking Duck ($38 for small): Paper-crisp skin, with nary a trace of fat, swaddled in soft egg rolls and burnished with sweet hoisin and fresh chives. The prawn crackers was a nice touch, I hardly see that served alongside peking duck anymore. 5) Deep Fried Sea Grouper with Sweet & Sour Sauce ($105 at $15\/100gm): sparkling fresh, lightly battered and fried to a delectable crisp, served swimming in a pool of sweetly piquant gravy dotted with peppers.6) Mango Pomelo ($8): smooth, creamy and refreshing7) Ingot Flower Tea ($8.80 per glass): kitschily served as a tight coil, which unwinds with the introduction of hot water. Expensive but really lovely tea.","828":"I feel like I'm missing out a great part of the Min Jiang experience because the family's never been there for their Peking duck--when they custom-build a roasting oven you know they're hard-core!We do like the place for dim sum though, a nice enough range (steamed, fried\/baked, sweets), and a tea menu with 8-ish choices means there's something for everyone. You can also order off the ala carte menu too--we did that today because vegetables are unfortunately not a dim sum food! The char siew pastry and the scallop dumplings were standouts; the goldfish dumpling (stuffed with prawn lah) was super adorable. It wasn't very crowded when we were there (we had an early seating) so I'm not sure why service was patchy. And some of the dumplings (siew mai, for example), was stuffed with chicken instead of pork. Still, decent dim sum in handsome surroundings.","829":"The dining room and environment are very nice. You overlook the hotel's pool, and the dining room itself has a nice welcoming feeling. I came in for the dim sum buffet, so \u00a0the offering were a bit limited. While the variety wasn't particularly impressive, all the standard dim sum offerings were there. I thought everything tasted pretty good, but nothing individually stood out. At $55 a head it was on the pricey side. Nonetheless I enjoyed the meal, but wasn't blown away.","830":"Had a great lunch for three, roughly $150 altogether. Has a nice formal ambiance for discussions and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, coming to periodically pour tea and provide clean plates for us. Started with peking duck, which was sliced in front of us and the served with pancakes and a variety of accoutrements, with the waiter offering to show us how to prepare the pancakes (never had a waiter offer that before). Afterwards we were treated to a second course of minced duck and vegetables, wrapped in lettuce, as part of the second course of the peking duck ordering.We also had seafood tofu (some of the nicest tofu I've ever had, nice and tender) and beef hor fun. Dessert was a delightful mango pudding.The quality of the food and atmosphere was fantastic, and was quite reasonable considering the price.As others have mentioned, it's tucked away in Rochester Park, which is a delightful strip in close proximity to Star Vista mall, Park Avenue Rochester hotel, the Biopolis and the Buona Vista MRT station.","831":"Although the duck is not sliced perfectly, this is the only decent place for beijing duck so far I've found in sg (Been living in Beijing for 5 years before came to Singapore). Other than this, other dishes I've tried are quite tasty and delicate.Lovely place and excellent service when they're not that busy - if you see almost every table occupied, don't expect their response\/food too quick; but except that, their service was always considerate and warm.","832":"Excellent duck and fixed price Hairy crab dinner! \u00a0The service was great & our group had a private room upstairs. There was something for everyone's taste whether spicy or not.","833":"Had an afternoon lunch with family. Surprised to see that the building was starting to show wear and tear. Needs to do with some maintenance. The crowd was sparse. Food was average for the price. Went for the regular dim sum selections. On average nothing outstanding. Although the Yang Zhou fried rice was quite well done. Could detect a whiff of wok hei.Didn't try their specialty Peking duck. Perhaps next time. Service was great by one of the staff. Very accommodating. Didn't catch her name though.","834":"excellent duckvery charming placeordered the duck and it perfectly cookedservice was goodstaff was very attentive","835":"I have already been a \"regular\" here before I knew of Yelp, and when they were at Clementi before shifting to Commonwealth before shifting to its current location at Holland Village.The clay pot chicken rice is not just good, it's great! And the price is not too steep either! For about $5\/pax, you can get a nice steaming pot of clay pot cooked over a legit charcoal oven (most food these days are cooked over gas stove), filled with salted fish, pork sausage and chicken. The plethora of flavors make this a really tasty dish (for halal customers you can also ask for the pork sausage to be removed). Rice is soft, chicken pieces are tender and the salted fish really adds a whole new dimension.Furthermore, you get to decide how much oil and black sauce to add. Usually I would add until about 90% of the rice grains are black (my stirring sucks, sadly), and oil until the grains are shiny enough. Yes, this sounds unhealthy, but once in a while dish, it's worth it!And usually, we would add some soup as a side. I recommend watercress soup.Note that the food centre is like almost entirely closed save for this stall at night, so seats are aplenty. And yes, like what the other reviewers have mentioned, call in advance to place your order, so you don't have to subject yourself to a 1.5hr wait. This is one of those stalls I would recommend to my friends, and it's also pretty accessible too!","836":"A simple dish, rice is topped with marinated chicken and Chinese sausages, cooked in a claypot over a charcoal flame which imparts it with a oh-so-good smoky flavour. The stall also sells vegetable and soup side dishes that go well with the claypot rice, making the meal more balanced.Most shops don't bother cooking over a charcoal flame these days due to the time and effort required, so this was a rare treat. Of course the downside is that it will take longer for your food to be prepared. So be wise and follow the advise of previous reviewers and call in your order in advance!","837":"First things first: ignore the earlier advice that tells you to call 45 minutes in advance; just call at least 1.5 hours ahead and tell them what time you want the food to be ready. Food's really got the \"burnt rice\" taste, which is what you are here for right? Not expensive, but we could have done with more generous portions of chicken and sausages. You can top-up for that. Chicken was nice and tender. Soup was a little salty, and definitely not the best I've had.","838":"I've been coming here since they were located in Clementi. It's one of those places that you think of and actually go to when you feel like something in particular, even if it's not great, it can always be counted on to deliver a pretty good rendition.In this case they specialize in claypot chicken rice. The taste of charcoal gives it a nice depth, which is my favourite part of any claypot rice. The soups are also quite good.Now that I know where they have moved to, I'll definitely check it out again when I crave claypot rice next.","839":"The thing about New Lucky claypot is that I associate it quite a bit with my childhood. I used to stay in Clementi when I was much younger and claypot rice for dinner was always a bi-weekly affair. Then I moved away and made my way back again when I was in university, only because of the proximity. Don't get me wrong, the claypot rice is actually pretty good in my opinion. \u00a0The stall still sticks to using charcoal for their cooking and this gives the final dish a nice smoky flavour. One thing I love is the little salted fish bits that they put inside the rice along with the chicken and sausage slices - there are others who think of them as nothing more than little balls of salt but I beg to differ.Part of the fun of going to New Lucky is being able to decide how much sauce goes into your dish. At the start of the meal, you are given two metal cups - one filled with dark sauce, the other with fragrant oil. And, they leave it entirely up to you how much you want to put into your rice. I have had an instance where this went horribly wrong and I ended up having to eat rich swimming in oil thanks to a friend's horrible estimation skills. So remember to leave the flavouring to someone trustworthy!","840":"New Lucky Claypot Rice was previously located right opposite Clementi central, but recently shifted to the Holland Food Centre, nearby Buona Vista MRT Station. I've always heard about how this claypot rice served with chicken was one of the best in Singapore, so I decided to give it a try once. While it is true that they are one of the rare stalls in Singapore still making use of charcoal to cook their rice, I don't find it to be as mind-blowing as some describe it to be. One good point however is how they add small pieces of salted fish to flavour the rice - which is not done by all stalls selling this dish. However the rice itself may or may not be too dry for my taste, and it is this inconsistency that I have a love-hate thing with. But to have it cooked for us true-blue Singaporean style with real charcoal is a great experience. Another plus point is that they serve various home-cooked soups as well. Try getting the lotus soup or black chicken soup to soothe your throat after a heaty meal like claypot rice - especially if you like the burnt rice portions like me!","841":"I am glad to see the mutton soup stall at the new bus interchange hawker centre. It's one of my favourite eating places when I was younger, besides the old bus interchange. The mutton is cooked to perfection, at least to my taste bud. Combining with the soup - every spoonful makes it enjoyable and the part I get disappointed is at the very last spoonful - no more left! Eat the mutton with the chilli sauce provided and you know what I mean. This stall has been around for many years and business is still as good as before.Many times I want to ask for another bowl but can't eat too much of it as it's not exactly healthy. Price has gone up but the serving is reasonable. So if you happen to be at Bedok Central, drop by here to enjoy, you won't be disappointed.","842":"This store has been around since I was a young kid. While the prices have increased, the quality has remained the same. Like many hawker stalls, the customer service for this store can be quite questionable but for a bowl of hot piping mutton soup, I am able to oversight this.The soup is of the thick and herbal kind and you can choose between a few varieties of mutton parts you want. The rich herbal soup taste masked the smell of the mutton, leaving only the sweet aroma as you bite into the meat. Definitely warms you up on a rainy day!","843":"I've been having this mutton soup since I was a kid and I really love it. However, I feel that standards have dropped a little. I remember going to the outlet in Tampines all the way till they closed. Nowadays, I come here instead. Without fail, I'll get the standard mutton soup with a mix of meat and mutton balls as well. For sides, I'll usually get the braised taupok as well as it completes my meal. What I like to do is dump my rice into the soup and eat from there. Throw in a little of their tangy chilli sauce and you've got the most heartwarming dish of mutton soup and rice waiting for you!","844":"This place has really good chinese style muttons soup. Its been around for a while, and it still taste the same as previously.You are able to choose different cuts of mutton, and inside bits of the goat, like the stomach. i usually just get a mixed bowl, which allows me to enjoy the different textures. The brooth is rich and tasty, with a very herbal nose. Ginger adds a sharpness to the soup. It also come s with a sweet sour chili sauce which goes fantastically well with the meats and the stomach.","845":"Nouri is a new restaurant opened by Ivan Brehm that markets itself as \"crossroads\" cuisine or \"food that takes influence from around the globe by showcasing the similarities and connections shared across cultures\". \u00a0There are two dining concepts - dinner in the dining room mainly at a communal table and smaller dishes at the bar for \"supper\". \u00a0We went for a 5 course tasting menu and definitely enjoyed it. \u00a0In fact, we were thinking that Nouri should be a Michelin winner, and later in the week, they were one of the new restaurants on the list! In any case, the honor is well-deserved as Nouri was one of the most interesting dining experiences I have had in Singapore. \u00a0The food is flavorful, artistic and thought provoking all at the same time. The meal started with simple courses like salmon roe on lettuce and concentrated jellied-broth before moving on to some complex dishes like a wild rice stem served withsteam roasted Makomotake, spiced buttermilk gratin, cultured cabbage. \u00a0The risotto with fermented Japanese chilli paste, aged carnaroli rice, and deep water scarlet prawns was extremely flavorful, while the Brazilian fritter was also quite good. \u00a0For the main course, we went with the grass-fed wagyu rump cap, which was so tender and very artistically presented with various oils and nasturtium leaves.Service was very solid, a bit off beat and very entertaining. \u00a0Our server knew the menu very well as well as made very interesting suggestion for wines. \u00a0After the Michelin awards, I expect that Nouri will become been more popular and it will be interesting to see how the menu and concept evolves. \u00a0So far, my favorite place in 2018!","846":"Came her for the last meal of our honeymoon and it was a fantastic experience. \u00a0The food was excellent. \u00a0The only dish on our tasting menu that I didn't really get into was the foi pho, but I do understand how that could be a more palatable presentation for the locals.The staff was extremely friendly, which is why we ended up being the last ones out of there at the ended of the night. \u00a0The only thing I thought was a little weird was how far it is to the restroom, there's probably not much they can do about that.","847":"There are just so many things to appreciate about a restaurant like this and how Julien Royer operates his kitchen whether it was his directive or his investors. His strictly local talent is incredible and the imagination is showcased in the dishes is beautiful. You can tell every chef and employee works hard yet loves what they do with all of their smiles. There is no pretentiousness like I'm noticing after the Stars have been awarded like in other restaurants where there once was no such thing (e.q. Corner House).I agree with Nik T that Odette was always in the shadows of the more adventurous and experimental Andre but now that the latter has closed its doors, Odette truly shines above all other Singapore Michelin Stars. The dishes are beautiful and full of flavor as well as many courses with the bells and whistles of dry ice and smoke.The ambiance is comfortable but the staff quickly makes you feel at home, very conversational and full of knowledge and warmth. Although this is a typical long tasting menu dinner, if there was any in Singapore to spend on that is uniquely Singapore, definitely do Odette.","848":"Odette @ National Gallery, Singapore2 Michelin StarsFrench Cuisine by Chef Julien Royer My 4-Course Set Lunch:Amuse-bouche : Conte cheese sponge cake with vinegar & walnut shavings - like a damp bread - don't like itChar pillow filled with aubergine filling - very nice although I'm not an aubergine fanPeas blah blah - okayMushroom with Sauvignon and wild mushroom tea poured on top with a bread that is more the texture of croissant- very niceXL Mozambique Langoustine - langoustine's texture was goodRosemary Smoked Organic Egg - very nice display but egg wasn't so hotQuercy Lamb Saddle - niceLemon Tart - very niceLovely lunch.

The only b\u00e9mol is certain dishes could have been served slightly warmer. Not overly long, but diverse and very good wine list (mainly French). One of the best service staff in Singapore - friendly, knowledgeable and pro-active. In my opinion, the best French restaurant in Singapore - more daring and 'passionate' yet less pretentious than its leading competitors.","851":"Odette is the latest hyped restaurant in Singapore and for our wedding anniversary, seemed to be a befitting location to celebrate by indulging. Dinner menus are priced $208 and $268 for 6- or 8-courses respectively. \u00a0Note that the 6-course dinner is not available from Friday and Saturday. Vegetarian menus are available too. We took both the normal menus to try. Upon seating, we were asked which type of water we would like, still or sparkling. $9\/person free flow seemed reasonable. Tap is available for free though. First up were canap\u00e9s. 4 bite-sized delights. All quite tasty (sorry can't remember the details). Followed by amuse bouche of mushroom \"tea\". This was good, full of umami though that a half piece of brioche as a chaser was unnecessary in my view. Then the bread platter arrived. A piece of tree bark was used in place of a plate. Presentation was great! 3 different types of bread were served - chia seed focaccia was our favorite, but the sourdough wedge was lovely too. The thyme brioche was the weakest link. The flavor wasn't intense enough to make any impact. Two different butters were served - salted lardo (yes, it's piggy fat) and unsalted butter. Then the meal was served proper. I shan't go into details of each plate but they were all well presented and tasty. But I wouldn't say it's overwhelming impressive, especially if they are aiming for the Michelin star. Service was choppy, my glass of water was empty for a good while before it was noticed and topped up. Most of the servers are foreigners and cannot enunciate their words properly. Dinner ended with petit fours, the lemon meringue lollipop was the most interesting and best of the lot. Canele was a close second though. A good experience overall but I won't be in a hurry to come back. Maybe for the less pricy lunch but not otherwise.","852":"This restaurant deservingly earned its Michelin star. The six course menu was creative, inviting and delicious. It also busted my belly. I don't know how people can take down the 8 course set. As with most fine dining, don't come here within a budget. Order with your stomach and not the wallet. My one criticism is that there is no dress code. A table of grown men came in with backpacks, sneakers and shirts, which betrays the spirit of fine dining. I might be a snob, so whatever, deal with it.","853":"Odette is a place that challenges your imagination of what food ought to be. \u00a0Full disclaimer I am not an adventurous eater so therefore I found the meal satisfying but challenging. \u00a0It is a 8 course gastronomy which takes you to tastes of a wide range. \u00a0The service is awesome and the crew does care about each guest's preference and request. \u00a0The wine list is extensive (even champagne by the glass has 5 choices!). \u00a0The ambience is fittingly perfect to a national gallery and kudos to the gov of thinking so far.Perfect place for celebrating an occasion and if you have not been - it is definitely worth to go.","854":"not quite five stars but a solid four.my benchmark for fine dining in SG will always be andre and unfortunately julien has yet to step out of his shadow.their space at the national gallery is a class act but not anywhere as panoramic as jaan.still, you will impress your date IF you bring one.their delightfully friendly and accommodating service team will further ensure you and yours are well taken care of.the pacing of the tasting menu was fine, with enough time to take that perfect food porn and with free wifi enabling you to upload instantly to yelp!as for the food, some dishes, the egg, the cepe tea and the dessert, were just too similar to jaan.nothing necessarily wrong but just a tad bit boring for my picky palate.the artisan bread selection with unsalted butter, prosciutto and lard spread will stave off any hunger pangs and increase serotonin to such levels, leading to happiness!the heirloom beetroot variation was a standout dish for me.i might well turn vegetarian if all non-meat dishes taste as such, beautiful to both eye and mouth!the seafood dishes were also noteworthy, fresh, simple ingredients assembled with complexity.desserts whilst satiating were nothing mind blowing, so maybe i will try their cheese supplement next time.now lo and behold, this is something that grandma odette can be proud of.","855":"Super restaurant. Deserving the 2 Michelin stars--perhaps even the third one -- may be on its way. Have one table in the kitchen itself and if you want to closely observe and almost be part of the creation, please try to request that. When you first seat down you are offered several excellent different champagnes--please be aware that these are not complimentary","856":"Went there in mid-Aug for a friend's birthday celebration so this review is rather late, but I have been missing their food ever since and am planning to go there again. There are many great restaurants in Singapore, but very few are delivering an innovative degustation menu like Odette. We had the six courses tasting menu, fell in love with the rosemary smoked organic egg immediately when we saw the presentation, experimental and full of surprises. The service is impeccable, and the ambience makes people feel relaxed and calm. So I say, definitely go try it out and you will not regret!","857":"Odette has probably been the most talked about restaurant in town for the last few months. The limited number of tables available and the fairly egalitarian reservation policy is a big factor, though some would say Julien is the biggest pull and who doesn't want to see the insides of the Supreme Court anyway? The wait time for a table on the weekend now stands at about 1.5 months, though cancellations do happen so I recommend calling up the hostess to leave your number. Fine dining restaurants usually have a \"money table\" and another for last minute special people but this doesn't exist at Odette, which I found out after several people came back to me empty handed.So was it worth the wait? I think the restaurant has a lot of potential and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, but I didn't walk away with my mind blown. So the answer is... \"I guess so\". There are clear signs of greatness in the attention to detail in plating picturesque dishes, the variety of flavors and textures and some theatrical sauce-pouring and smoke. The price point is incredible value as well at $128 for 6 creative courses. Plus I love the design of the restaurant - it makes one feel calm, uncluttered and chic. I liked my amuse bouche, pork belly and bread (don't laugh...the restaurants that ace bread-making tend to make great food too) but I was also bored by the play it safe ingredient list: Truffles in every other fish? Check. Pork belly? Check. Foie gras? Check. Given how well the dishes were executed, why not be adventurous with the produce? I've heard the French are as nose-to-tail happy as Chinese to some degree after all. There lies the problem I suppose - I didn't think any dish was bad but I didn't find anything so unique or memorable that I could recall its name or contents a week later. Yes I was with a work-related acquaintance and so my mind wasn't 100% focused on the food, but I tried Per Se in a similar context and could still remember the piece of SRF slow cooked beef I had that melted in my mouth, the famous pearls and the insane ending line-up of desserts. I will end by saying that I'm still tempted to return to try the dinner degustation because the chefs could have been limited by the affordable price point required at lunchtime. In a way, I think the food at Odette is like a straight A student at the PSLE exams - schooled in good techniques and scoring points, but needs to use that to express some real creativity and risk to achieve greatness. \u00a0Let's see what happens.","858":"My first time at the National Gallery and my first time trying Julien Royer's food (I think). I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end meal. My wife and I tried the 6 and 8 course meals, surprisingly not that different. We walked in without a reservation, so it's not one of those places you have to book weeks in advance. Food was 4 out of 5 stars. Service was 5 out of 5 stars. I imagine this place will be a 2 star when Michelin comes to town. I would come back here for a special occasion.","859":"Amazing Spanish-Latin fusion food. I've been there several times, and surely woll go many more. The staff is fantastic and extremely professional, the food is outstanding, and the wine-list is spectacular. Make sure you have an Anna de Codorniu cava glass to start with.Location is perfect, and they have several events with winemakers and chefs, which makes the place that much more special.Excellent choice!","860":"Came here for a business lunch. We ordered the ceviche, prawns, jamon iberico and paella. Everything was pretty much on point, though nothing in particular stood out. OLA is a rarity in Singapore for waiving corkage if you are a regular. Service is excellent, especially the very knowledgeable sommelier.Will be back!","861":"Good food good ambiance great serviceThis place is casually classy. The food quality is excellent and the ambiance is great for a business lunch. Not too noisy and not too quiet. Does not feel busy though the customers are consistently filing in.The roast pork is definitely the highlight, squid ink rice and pasta deserves a mention. I would reorder those again during my next visit.Price is high, but for the location and ambiance it is reasonable.","862":"I would definitely come back. We had two Counter Lunch Sets for $28 each. Comes with two bite-sized appetizers and a main. The Seafood Pasta and the Fisherman's Seafood Stew were filling yet delicately light. We ordered Frutas for dessert and today's seasonal fruit was melon. Very succulent and delicious with homemade vanilla ice cream! Would come back for the friendly service and amazing food :)","863":"The cosy restaurant, innocuously tucked away at the commercial hub that is MBFC, has been surreptitiously churning out Spanish cuisine with a Peruvian inclination. It's totally underrated, and flies so low under the radar, that it was 3 years before I learned of its illustrious lineage: Ola's head chef was the executive chef of the short-lived celebrity restaurant Santi at MBS.Dinner-time will find the restaurant a lot more chilled and tranquil, compared to the frenzied boisterousness of the lunchtime crowd. I much prefer dinners here; there's a languorous ambience perfect for savouring OLA's exquisite tapas. Service is also a lot more intimate and attentive. We had:1) 36-months aged Jamon Iberico '5J' ($48): sublime fatty salty ribbons of cured pork shoulder sided by catalan toasts and fresh tomato puree. Pricey, but sublime nonetheless.2) Burrata with Pesto ($35) with heirloom tomatoes, edamame, and crispy jamon curls: an off-menu special that was a fantastic recommendation by the affable manager. Incredibly balanced in terms of flavour and texture, this is a must-try if ever it's in season.3) Gambas ($25) - of fresh sweet prawns swimming in a medley of roasted garlic oil, dried chilli, and espelette pepper: heady and aromatic. Dish with the complimentary crusty bread, great fodder for the robustly flavoured oil.4) Pulpo ($26): Spanish octopus grilled to a luscious and smoky finish, and complemented by a nutty lentil sauce, and lightly spiced romesco vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of octopus (the tentacles scare me), but even I was blown away by this.5) Conchas a la Parmesana ($35): a duo of plump Hokkaido scallops baked to a succulent caramelization, was set atop parmesan grains, and a creamy lime and brandy aioli. Decent, but not outstanding.6) Fiduea con Secreto Iberico y Setas ($45): loved the flavourful noodle paella dish loaded with organic oyster mushrooms and grilled iberico pork, even if my galfriend found its sweet undertones disconcerting.7) Ceviche ($25): only lackluster dish where the potent taste of the wild seabass overwhelmed the delicate flavours of the lime, chilli, and onion marinade","864":"firstly, if you are driving, you have to park at MBFC tower 2 and then walk over to tower 3.the setting here is cozy and rustic.the wait staff were all really friendly and proactive.staff to customer ratio is also above average standard.their sparkling san pellegrino was $7.50 and not the usual $12 that i've come to expect.their sangria which was rated as 11\/10 by one of their staff, had a good proportion of chopped fruits in it.to our pleasant surprise, chef pepe came to our table just as we were about to order.he made some friendly banter and asked if we trust him to do the ordering for us.we immediately closed the menu and gladly left it all to him.to start off was their rustic bread and gazpacho.refreshingly chilled with the right acidity and 2 halves of tomatoes inside.next up was a gourmet starter of the day.a burrata, jamon salad with fresh figs and tomatoes.nice creamy burrata, savoury jamon and the sweetest figs ever!then the morcon, cured spanish pork sausage with paprika on crunchy toasted bread.the piquillo, peppers stuffed with salt cod, was a nice warm combo of spicy, sweet and saltiness.the calamares, was fresh and lightly fried with a tasty squid ink sauce.my favourite of the evening has to be the pulpo, char grilled octopus with paprika and potatoes.very tender to the knife and bite.no chewiness whatsoever.plus a good amount of seasoning to make you crave for more.the main event for the night was their suckling pig, which was not even on the menu.wafer \u00a0thin crisp skin with thick flesh of porkiness.served with mushrooms, leeks and mesclun leaves.for dessert, we had the crema catalana, creme brulee with orange scent that was not cloyingly sweet.and peras al vino tinto, red wine pears with cinnamon cake and honey ice cream that concluded my evening in sweet sophistication and style.throughout the evening, chef pepe was at hand to chat and solicited our comments.this was a 4.5 verging on 5 stars experience.","865":"Great food and service, but it's simply very expensive for lunch. My average bill for 2 persons is above $200 as I always go with their recommendation. But for business, it's worth it.","866":"Paella was so so awesome. Not soggy and the best part was it had crispy bits and was just full of flavor. Please order it! Ordered the noodle paella with crustacean and it came with prawns. Yum!!!! Three thumbs up! Sangria was superb too, infused to the right amount.","867":"It's sometimes hard to rate a restaurant that does one thing brilliantly well, but everything else is mediocre. That's kinda the case with Ola. The gazpacho here is worth 5 stars. No doubt about it, hands down the best I've had in Singapore. I almost wanted to order one for dessert, it was that good. Coupled with the rustic, crusty bread they serve? Heavenly.Everything else though? Good but unspectacular. For tapas, we had the grilled octopus, the calamari, and the croquettas. I enjoyed all three, to be fair, but the grilled octopus, while tasty, wasn't quite there in terms of texture, and didn't quite match up to my standard for grilled octopus here in Singapore. The calamari was... interesting, I enjoyed the sauces, it was fresh, well cooked, but not... mind-blowing, if you know I mean. It was good, but not memorable. Croquettas. I love croquettas, and the ones here are definitely worth ordering... but not worth going to the restaurant for. Crisp, creamy, generously sized, personally (and this really is a personal thing) I think it could have used a little bit more potato to offset the creaminess. Some people like creamy though, so don't let me discourage you from trooping down to give it a try.For mains we ordered the seafood stew and the paella. The paella... was average. I preferred BOMBA's, and we didn't even finish it because it wasn't really attention grabbing in terms of flavour or texture. The seafood stew was fresh, and a very generous portion, but the broth was a little thin for it to be a 4 or 5 star dish.The Sangria however, was EXCELLENT. If you're a fan of sangria that's fruity, light, and refreshing, then you'll love Ola's. So... yeah. I'm admittedly a little picky and don't hand out 4 or 5 star ratings that easily, but Ola was a pleasant meal, and they're worth visiting (or even revisiting). But I wouldn't say \"I'm a fan\".","868":"Visited Osteria Art on a Wed for lunch and made good use of the Entertainer app. We used the app twice to get 2 dishes free (ordered 4 dishes to share among 5 of us). We started the meal with complimentary freshly-baked focaccia, which was warm and fluffy. The waiters were nice enough to inform us that the orders would take a while to arrive since the kitchen was better suited to expedite the set lunches during the weekday lunch slot. Was recommended and ordered the daily special, the uni pasta, which was delicious, if not slightly heavy, but perfect for sharing. Highly recommend this dish if it's available. The truffle tagliolini was tasty as well, creamy with a strong taste of truffle. We also shared the cod and the pork cheek among us. I personally preferred the pork cheek, which was tender, flavorful and beautifully presented. The cod could have been slightly less fishy, but I did enjoy the accompanying veggies. Vey value for money with the Entertainer app ($120), with high quality food and good ambience. Would return!","869":"The restaurant is one of many restaurants under the Il Lido group. It is a elegant Italian restaurant and bar by Beppe De Vito. The restaurant is located just behind One Raffles and just a stone throw from the Raffles Place MRT station. The place is simple in decoration from the main street. One would just take it as another bar place with its high chairs in the alfresco dining area. But inside it is elegant looking which reminds one of the old Hollywood movies with its white table cloths and comfortable leather armchairs.Surprisely this year the restaurant is taking part in the restaurant week event and offers a 4 course dinner set meal at $58++ per person.But what is a meal here without its signature artisanal pastas? Therefore we decided to add an additional order of pasta.Pappardelle with Pork Cheek & Red Wine ($28++)The pasta was the flat and broad type, which had a soft and chewy texture. The pork cheek was in small cubes and tasted quite well braised, which reminded me of the chinese style Tau Yu Bak (Soy Sauce Braised Pork Belly). The fatty pork fat was crispy and melt in the mouth which I could not get enough of it. One serving of this was simply not enough.We started the meal with bread roll, served with vinegar and olive oil dip. The bread was soft and pillowy.For amuse bouche, we were served deep fried balls, filled with molten cheesy filling and topped with shredded cheese.Scallop Carpaccio with Fava Beans, Quail Egg and Raspberry BalsamicoIt was light and simple dish to start the meal with, although I wish that the scallop had been sliced thinner.Crab ravioli with lobster bisque and basil foamThe ravioli was very tender and juicy on its own, but with the lobster bisque the dish became a bit too salty to have.Atlantic cod with sea urchin zabaglione, sunchoke and RomanescoThe creamy rich yellowish sea urchin which tasted of the sea, and the earthly greyish sunchoke gave a dish a unique taste. Interesting to have the dish decorated with Romanesco broccoli (also known as Roman cauliflower or pagoda cauliflower [yes it was sold as pagoda cauliflower in Giant supermarket]). However the strong flavours of the sauces failed to balance with the fish. The fish seem to be a bit too firm in texture.Amalfi lemon & white chocolate lingotto with red berriesLemony flavoured white chocolate mousse with crunchy chocolate pops in it, sitting on top of the chocolate sponge. The sweet and light cake balanced by the slightly sour raspberries. There was also a small patch matcha flavoured sponge in the centre. Interesting different flavours.We ended the meal with coffee and tea, served with sugar coated peanuts.Overall the food was great although I felt that the restaurant week set meal had not showcased the best of what the restaurant can offer. The service offered by the staffs was great. The staffs were knowledgeable, even for the young looking one when we asked him about the ingredients in the dish. Water was refilled often. Bread crumbs left by the crispy bread was cleared smoothly by the staff with a metal stick. The only exception was that the place was quite noisy when the restaurant was packed. Another thing to note was that there was free wifi in the restaurant. It was rare to find such an atas looking offering this service.","870":"Visiting Osteria Art for Restaurant Week dining was a last minute arrangement from my pal. I have not heard of her name till last week when I was introduced to this elegant Italian restaurant and bar by Beppe De Vito.It threw me a surprise as I did not expect the environment being upscale and immediately I felt as though I'm in a foreign country with most of their staff being Caucasians. The outer part of the dining place is a Alfresco area installed with ceiling fans and laid with beautiful furnishings and Italian Marble. And since its located in a strategic location among the CBD offices, do check out their exquisite bar lounge right next to its entrance.As you walked deeper into the restaurant, \u00a0feel the ambiance while you enjoy a good passion for Italian Cuisine with quality and freshness of ingredients. The 80 Seater Osteria environment lays a comfortable European feel with dining table neatly spread with white table cloth and bright red leather chairs.Let's start off the Italian gastronomic heritage with our Restaurant Week Dinner Menu at $58++ per pax...Besides dipping the warm buns into balsamic vinegar oil, what I like best was these 2 soft sponge starters that contains cheese in them!Plain water for the teetotalers...The overlapping of scallops was topped with fava beans and elegantly decorated with flowers and the halves of Quail Egg. Paring the starter with raspberry balsmico gave a different taste to the plain sweet scallop. If you love sashimi, you will love the texture of this dish!Pappardelle was our additional order on top of the restaurant week menu. These large, board flat pasta noodles were perfectly cooked and was really delicious in its red wine sauce and shredded cheese topping. I enjoyed their softness of pork cheek which literally melts in your mouth. Crispy pork lards \/ belly meats had not only added another texture to the dish but also gave a good aroma to it.Pappardelle with Pork Cheek & Red Wine - $28The miniature size of ravioli had immediately caught my attention with its green foam and brown lobster bisque that was generously spread on top of the pasta. These Ravioli contained shredded crabs meat in its bag. As a whole, its a dish proportionately spread out and their sauce left my lips wanting for more.Colors of the dish is interestingly match among 3 colours here and ravioli within a size of a table spoon.Here comes the main with a large cube of Atlantic Cod sitting on Sea Urchin Zabaglione with Sunchoke paste underneath and Romanesco Broccoli as sides. Other than the Cod on this main dish, all the rest was my very first try out. Initially, I'm not very use to the taste of Zabaglione and sea urchin but after a few mouthful of it, I got addicted. Though I'm someone who enjoys the freshness of consuming cod fish, the style of its preparation was not to my likingAmazing ending to the meal with a good dessert that kind of act as a palate cleanser to the seafood dish earlier on. A mixture of black, rasp and strawberry fruits on its top layer with some matcha sponge cake while in the second layer it was well done with white chocolate that was not too sweet. What I like about the middle layer was the little crunchy chocolate balls surprises in between the bites. And finally, a good closing up to the meal with our tea and coffee in place accompanied by some sugar coated peanuts.To be frank, it was a great opportunity to have visited Osteria Art. I love how my dining was without any hurry to rush us off even after we completed our meals. Waiters will still continue to top up our glasses of plain water. Praises to their service and not only that, waiter that served us was well trained , knowledgeable and knows the menu well.Bearing the mind of its ambiance and budget, it is best recommended for special occasion.","871":"Power lunch today (business so no pictures :( ) at Osteria Art. Menu at $35++ is very good value given the quantity and quality. Starter chosen was the Tuscan chickpea soup with garlic breadcrumbs. Too bad the soup was a little under seasoned. Main chosen was the braised lamb shank with potato mash. I was glad the shank was regular sized and not skimpy just cuz it is lunch. And moreover, meat was tender and flavorful without the gaminess. The mash tasted quite buttery so I didn't finish it up (I don't like the overwhelming butter taste). Dessert was a petit portion of pistachio cake topped with a layer of chocolate ganache and then pistachio mousse. Accompanying is an almond biscuit and some sour berry compote. \u00a0I felt these were a little out of place on the dessert plate. Lastly, coffee or tea of your choice. Finished the lunch in 1 hour 15 mins. Decent for a power lunch !","872":"Osteria Art probably has the best wine list of Italian wines in the CBD, and maybe even all of Singapore. Unfortunately, it's paired with one of the pushiest sommeliers I've come across anywhere in the world. I understand it was a slow day, but he literally wouldn't leave my companion and I alone for more than ten minutes. The food was pretty decent, but it was an unpleasant enough experience that I won't be back.","873":"So, another Italian place, and I am determined to find a better restaurant than Trattoria Nonna Lina. This is not it.The service looked pompous and fancy. It wasn't. it was decently attentive. it's not a big deal toward the overall meal, but for the large size of the place, I counted 4 people serving tables.The food was not bad. Ok, the deep fried calamari was good, but it's deep fried, with batter. How can you ruin that?The seafood soup was ok. Marginal. The bowl was huge, and the seafood was...hidden...somewhere.My main was a seabass with spinach and tomato puree. It was ok. Nothing special.And then there was dessert. It was a flavour play on strawberry compote with olive sponge cake. The cake was sweet, so I was confused, and then, the sweet strawberry, made a little more sense. But not by much.Overall, for 2 people, with one cocktail, the bill was $85 per person. Market street, CBD pricing, but nothing special for Italian.","874":"Value for price? Amazing! For $3 you get a medium-sized portion of tasty fried kway teow. You will have to wait for around 30-40 minutes during the lunch hour, but it is worth it. The stall is sort of hit or miss in terms of the portion size, but generally you get enough for a small-ish lunch--I was certainly satisfied. If you're with a group send multiple people out to scout for seating while you wait in line. The stall aunty will come down the line to collect your order and payment and you will pick up your portions immediately as you get to the front of the line.","875":"I hardly eat char kway teow and the one that is stuck in my memory is from the early 90s when I was still a kid and the price was $1 a plate (slowly creeping up to $1.20, $1.50, $2 etc). On this trip back to Singapore I made it a quest to find a good char kway teow and this plate was pretty awesome. It has lots of hums (cockles) and bits of crispy pork lard. It is not too wet or dry. Unfortunately it does not have much of a wok hei flavor. Plus there is no lup cheong (Chinese sausage). But this is definitely a wow if you are a cockle lover. The queue is not very long at 1030am on weekdays, maybe about 10-15 mins wait.","876":"Is this what they called the best in Singapore??? Totally soggy and all clumps together. Cannot taste any fried taste, more like boiled only. The Long queue probably due to the good amount for the price. For the amount, one more star.Overly rated. Not worth the wait. Cannot even tastes the pork cracklings. No Chinese sausages Nor fish cake.","877":"A bit of redemption on our most recent visit here for a place that is well-known for their fried kway teow, but failed to impress us the first time around. Same crazy line at the hawker center, same guy behind the wok, but something different I tasted this time around. Pork cracklins! I'm pretty positive this is something new added as I think I would have remembered tasting it before. Overall, the fried kway teow was quite delicious and didn't have that fishy aroma I remembered last time even though the cockles were aplenty in our dishes. The line was definitely worth it this go around.","878":"Add cockles for $1 sgdFried \u00a0kway teow mee $3 sgdThe noodle was good but saturated too much in sauceThe cockles were ok but not quiet fresh tasting completely Open 6am to 4pmLocated in food court upstairs Singapore hawker masters 2010 winnerRecommend to bring cash and napkins","879":"The secret is the pork lard.One of the best, not the best. I like this version of sweet char kway tiao for the longest time. And the secret is the crunchy pork lard. The chilli can be better so that keeps me from giving the fifth Star.Eat it when it's hot, that's the best flavor!","880":"due to some serious jetlag, me and justin b. were wide awake early in the morning and since Outram Park opens at 6am, we were there first thing for a breakfast of fried kway teow haha. at about $2-3 USD, this is a great value for a great meal. there was absolutely no line at 6am and we actually might have been the first customers of the day haha. the noodles are cooked fresh for you and it was a delicious way to start my day. lots of good flavors and texture to this dish - you've got some crunch, diff types of noodles, and a slight spice kick. so good!","881":"Very good char kuey teow. Good char on the noodles , lots of garlic - tasty indeed. A good serving of cockles for those who like it.","882":"Breakfast of champions: char tway teow with teh o'ais limau. I am totally addicted to char kway teow and eat as much of it as I can when I'm Singapore or Malaysia, so I was pretty excited that I could get some of the good stuff as early as 6am. Filled with delicious crunchy pork lard and rice noodles, it's not exactly a healthy start to the day, but damn it's good. I came early in the day and it wasn't too busy, so the kway teow mee was served fast and fresh for just $3. I shared it with my partner and with the heat that had already kicked in, was enough to keep us going until lunch (though I could have easily smashed one to myself without hesitation!).The cockles are very fishy, so if that isn't your thing I would recommend ordering without it. We opted for extra chilli and it was well spiced. Definitely a dish I will be missing at home and having been to Penang the day after this visit, can say it's right up there as one of the better noodle dishes I had on this trip.","883":"Definitely the best char kway teow in Singapore. I usually avoid going 11:30am to 2:30pm. The wait time is crazy.Very simple. Cockles, noodles, bean sprouts, lots of garlic and lard. No Chinese sausage or fish cakes. I get mine with $2 extra cockles, fried white with extra chili.RTE whenever I'm in Singapore.","884":"so where do you get char kway teow at 6am in the morning?here la!truth be told, i've not had a plate of char kway teow for ages!but somehow, army food just makes you crave what you cant get inside.since it's early in the morning, there isnt a queue.order, pay and be seated.they will deliver to your table even though it says self-service, i guess only when they arent busy.my previous complains about them is that their version tends to be too dry.but today it was very much to my liking.together with nicely cooked(not under and not over) cockles(albeit a little small).every now and then you also get a delightful crunch of crispy pork lard!breakfast of champions?","885":"Great kway teow for only 3 dollars. Make sure you get extra egg!","886":"First time I've ever tried char kway teow. Quite delicious. I got mine with spice which made this dish extra special. You can choose to have your dish with or without cockles (blood clams). I did both. Cockles have a very potent taste. Too potent... and I generally love extreme tastes. This preparation includes small bits of crispy pork skin for even more kick. Enjoy!","887":"I think the saying goes, \"you eat with your eyes first.\" \u00a0Unfortunately, fried kway teow is not a pretty looking dish with its brownish, grayish color, noodles all jumbled together forming an indistinguishable pile of stuff. \u00a0But, my first and, so far, only encounter with this dish wasn't that bad; I expected as much given the line that snaked through the food court when we arrived. \u00a0When we made it to the front, we could see the the chef--a one man noodle frying machine churning out dish after dish of fried kway teow. \u00a0His shirt was soaked and beads of sweat trickled down his brow over his face. \u00a0I found his quickness impressive, but I couldn't help thinking of the possibility of a stray droplet of sweat making its way into our dish. \u00a0It was a good sized serving of the fried noodles. \u00a0A thick sauce coated the noodles, making everything the same color so I couldn't tell what yummy little bits were contained in my chopstick-full of noodles. \u00a0The cockles were a chewy surprise, though there were some pieces that had cockle intestines oozing out; I just gave those pieces to the mister. \u00a0Overall, a yummy, interesting dish that I wouldn't hesitate to try again.","888":"This is hands down, the BEST char kway teow you can get in Singapore. It's almost an institution and you cannot say you've had char kway teow until you have eaten here. Waiting times can get insane, especially during lunch hour, and waits of up to 45mins are really common. The old chef is a master at what he does, and he cooks it non-stop till the crowds begin to dissipate near the end of lunch hour before taking a break and closing. The pricing is insane as well, for the incredible standard of the char kway teow served - $3 for the standard serving, $1 extra for more cockles, 50c for more egg. Guaranteed to leave you wanting more.","889":"I'm a huge fan of char kway tiao; it's no doubt really sinful but I just can't resist the smooth pieces of kway tiao and the pork lard. The char kway teow here was moist but not overly greasy. Just the right amount of sweet dark sauce to accent the savoriness, yet not overpowering it, and plenty of wok hei. Finally, the spicy chili gave this simple hawker dish just that bit of oomph. The Ingredients included the usual beansprouts, cockles, fish cake and pork lard. Most notable was, of course, the succulent cockles and ultra-crispy pork lard. Overall, definitely one of the best char kway tiao that I have eaten, and no doubt very highly recommended!","890":"It's one of the best if not the best Char Kway Teow in Singapore. \u00a0It's done the Singapore style i.e. a bit wet. \u00a0The cockles is done just right ..... al dente! \u00a0Long queue is to be expected but definitely less than an hour. \u00a0Very affordable pricing. \u00a0A $3 plate is usually sufficient for me!","891":"Soooooo tasty. Best Char Kway Teow in the country, for realz. Long lines during lunch. You'll be hard-pressed to find a table anywhere, but take it to go and huddle in some park around just gobble up the goodness. Just do it","892":"The crowds at Hong Lim Complex FC can get insane, and it pays to go there a little early for the good stuff. Found this place upstairs and towards the middle of the unusually shaped hawker centre. They serve char kway teow and that is all. $3 for the standard serving, $1 extra for more cockles, 50c for more egg. The cook had just finished the last batch when I arrived, so I got to watch him work, and he is a master at it.He deserves 9.5\/10 for the food, but I had to round down for the lack of sliced pork. Otherwise, everything was fantastic and delicious. If you are in the area, stand in line, watch the master work, then savor his art.","893":"Get the extra egg and cockles! You deserve it after waiting on the line. The closest thing to Penang char kway teow that I've ever found in Singapore, imho. The addition of the crispy pork nicely disguised in all the mess in the plate was definitely genius!","894":"The best Kway Teow I have had ever. \u00a0Not oily like most places. \u00a0My 7 year old daughter loved it without the chilli or cockles.","895":"A must stop for me if I ever have a chance to visit Singapore again! The chee cheong fun were so tasty, they brought back all the wonderful childhood memories that I had when it came to this type of food. I love all the different meats or just the plain ones with soy sauce.","896":"This is fresh, silky goodness, hand made to order when you order. Go with the prawn or plain chee cheong fun. I found the char siu average and the scallop chewy. Havent tried the abalone. The wait can be long since everything is made a la minute, but you can spend the time looking at all 20 photos of chow yun fat posing with the proprietors.(Apparently, they didnt want to take his money when they saw him but he insisted)One of the best chee cheong funs in sg. Chow yun fat might even agree!","897":"They only do one type dish here- the only choice you have is what type of meat you want in it-but they do it to perfection! Highly recommended.","898":"Worth the wait! The rice rolls are nice and thin, the shrimp is plump and moist and the BBQ pork is finely chopped. Prices are on point.","899":"if any stall can define pek kio food centre then Pin Wei is it!even the business photo for the food centre shows a plate of Pin Wei's craftsmanship!a customized JIT set up with 2 identically rectangular flat steamers lying alongside another similarly sized, greased, flat work surface where a liquid rice mixture flows in from one end onto muslin cloths lining the steamers, gets subjected to the laws of science regarding a change of physical state then undressed by being separated from it's host clothing to reveal a slippery smooth, silky thin cheong fun before being rolled to give extra depth or in cases where foreign objects such as char siew, prawns, scallops or abalone were introduced, to provide a seductively sheer yet protective layer for them foreign talent, then cut up into bite sizes as it emerges at the other end of this continuous work flow, minimally moisturized with a slightly sweet light soy sauce, fragrantly peppered with sesame seeds and further spiced up, as you deem fit, with homemade chilli.this, is a precision assembly line that will meet ISO 9001 standards at hawker prices.this, is a master handcrafted product that will gluttonously glide down your throat to your eagerly awaiting bellies.this, is satisfaction guaranteed or your money ......................... \u00a0is out of pocket!:)","900":"If I am ever in Pek Kio, fretting over the long lines at Wah Kee Prawn Noodles, we will always order this chee cheong fun.The chee chong fun are made on the spot when you order, and it is like those served in HK dimsum restaurants. These are thin and soft, either plain, with char siew, or shrimps, or scallops or abalone.I actually like the plain ones as they comes with a good sesame oil\/soy sauce mixture which is really yummy. Shrimps one comes a second for me.","901":"Extremely tasty and soft, fresh -- unlike any you are likely to find in a restaurant. \u00a0 A must go to have....","902":"A magnificent setting, good honest food, slightly high but mostly justified prices, marred by a couple false touches which are fair enough for Singapore. I was excited to finally make it to Pollen. A friend whose palate I trust enormously held it as the best in Singapore a few years ago yet the location made it hard to convince either friends or the other inhabitant of the home to trek there - and locals know Marina Bay Gardens well enough that the location is not that exotic anymore. Unfortunately it seems Atherton has left; fortunately his replacement used to be at the Claridges in London which back when I was there had a solid reputation. The little train from the taxi stand is an amusing start, although had the sun been out in force we may not have enjoyed it as much. The location was indeed very nice, not just the Dome but the indoor decoration, spacious, with enough space between tables to have some privacy, yet open and well lit (as you'd expect in a giant greenhouse). It is REALLY cold inside, but we were forewarned and brought woolly things. Felt just like London really. My first thought with every dish was how British that cooking was. Well sourced ingredients, prepared simply without artifices to hide their flavour, chosen to match each other. This is the Michelin\/nouvelle cuisine equivalent of comfort food and to be honest a welcome sight, we're a bit tired of foam and smoke with no taste, the excitement should be on the fork. The tarte tatin is for some reason sold as a portion for two; well, I could have finished it myself, it was very well done. That's why it gets its own paragraph. Of course this, as well as the great bread, would not have been as noticeable in Europe with its plethora of French and French-trained chefs and bakers, but here, it is rare enough to warrant ignoring the banana ice cream and jelly option (whose gula melaka was the only trace of a nod to local tastes I could find). Now some minor criticisms: 55++ for a three course lunch is quite steep, however the location may explain it; the wine options were so boring we ignored the list; the cocktails (whose list is even more limited than before) seem unimaginative and using cheap bases which detract from the restaurant; the old list shown on a 2012 review has Hakushu 12yo, this one either Bacardi or Malibu rum. That would have been an easy 22++ they lost out on. I'd recommend the restaurant manager visit the Auld Alliance and chat with their manager about ideas for interesting stuff without breaking the bank. Finally, the lonely cheese board looked quite miserable with few options, none AOC\/fermier, all quite boring, in other words some branches of Cold Storage have more choice and perhaps better quality. I only looked at it twice though, but again, an easy 10++ with a bit of thinking. If the Swissotel Equinox buffet can have free flow raw milk AOC 18 month aged cheese Pollen can afford to up their game. The chocolates at the end were not bad, however the \"fennel\" was absent from its namesake piece. All in all, this is a solid choice to take guests from abroad who will enjoy the surroundings. Not a bad option for a Sunday lunch either. If only they sorted out their booze...","903":"Besides its location inside the flower dorm of gardens by the bay, this little cafe has nothing going for it. The service is terrible: slow and unfriendly. The drinks are expensive: $7 for an iced latte. You're better off passing by the cafe and eating elsewhere in my opinion. I can't say anything about the food since they don't serve food between their lunch and dinner service, but they use fresh herbs that grow in the little garden beds surrounding the dining area. I guess that's pretty cool. They do have a large variety of beverages, from wine and beer to coffee and tea. I just wish the service was a little better to match the high price tag.","904":"Great place to grab a break for a cold drink. \u00a0You will need a cold drink after the walk to here. \u00a0 Singapore is hotttt.","905":"Big fan. Not sure if he's Steve Allen, but the chef who served up our High Tea did a grand job. We were absolutely pleased. Service was swift, although a bit too swift. With High Tea one needs a little more time to nurse the wine, enjoy the aromatic teas and more so enjoy the treats.Here's a tip for Pollen - serve up the savories first individually. Not all at once. Leave the menu on the table so your patrons can review the items they have been served with. With the tray that had everything on board, we weren't really sure which was which. Bottom line - darn good treats for high tea, good service, allow your patrons to be charmed by your treats, but give them time.Yes, I'll come back.This review was for a visit on Apr 25 2017","906":"We popped into Pollen for an evening meal and a drink on Sunday night. The venue was a little quiet and we were moved from a table that was never taken up by the time we left.Perhaps we are ugly because they moved us behind a column.We ordered a light plate of sour dough with hummus and smoked butter. It was ok. As an after thought I realise the western restaurants this place attempts to emulate typically provide bread as an appetiser. Not yet normal in Singapore.We ordered the risotto with beef cheeks and the ribeye steak. The plates appear of a conservative size but were filling. The beef was well cooked and if I were to go again I'd order all of it again.The restaurant has daily offers but they are subject to demand and both the desserts of the day were gone by the time it came to us at 7pm.The only thing that was a bit bizarre was the service. We ordered water that didn't come until the third time of asking and plates were cleared before everyone on the table had finished eating.Table water is also expensive at 5sgd per person (possibly by cup- we didn't confirm that).","907":"A long wait, and disappointing food selection. We visited on a public holiday, and I guess everyone, including us, wanted a seat in the beautiful flower dome. We waited. The servers were not very friendly. Rather brusque and kept saying they have no idea how long the wait is, and we can just stand around to wait.Luckily a table left in 15 minutes, and we took the spot! Ordering is at the cashier, rather weird, for a cafe\/restaurant looking of certain calibre. A long line of customers were waiting to get their orders taken. We were really excited about beignets and arancini, but sadly the beignets were not available... (AND not indicated on the menu!!) The arancini came. Small cute cripsy balls, could be more cheesy.. And strangely without any tomato sauce. but ok, the flavor was reasonable. The thing I could not BELIEVE, was that there was a strand of hair EMBEDDED In my arancini. NO. I will not accept an arancini of this calibre. eew. it totally turned my appetite off after that. Sigh. Otherwise, the cafe is set in a beautiful location! Just need new staff, new management and new kitchen.","908":"This place isn't equipped to handle the number of tables available. Waited 45+ minutes just for tea and a lemon tart. Luckily I wasn't in a rush and simply read on my smartphone. Neighboring tables had some bad service too. Good atmosphere but it is largely a waiting game at this restaurant. They have a six sigma problem. It is uncharacteristic to have such a poorly run establishment in a first class attraction like the Gardens By the Bay. Its processes need to be analyzed by the VP of Operations or whoever runs the operations program at the Gardens.","909":"This is a review of the fine dining restaurant (downstairs of the more casual cafe which serves the high tea). \u00a0Eight of us dined there today for lunch. \u00a0The service, as I remembered from a previous visit, \u00a0was impeccable. \u00a0 There's attention to every detail and it was almost as if our table had its own dedicated waiter and sommelier. \u00a0The restaurant is tucked away inside the back corner of the Flower Dome. \u00a0When you arrive by taxi or car, a chauffeured buggy will carry you to the back door\/main entrance of Pollen. \u00a0Inside the restaurant, the ceiling is low and the space is brightly lit with 100% natural lighting and offers views of the Singapore Flyer and Guests making their way around the outdoor gardens. \u00a0The furnishings are comfortable and the space is bordered by an indoor planted berm. \u00a0It \u00a0reminds me of dining on a really nice outdoor patio. \u00a0(But remember you're inside the air conditioned flower dome)All eight of us ordered from the three course set lunch menu ($55++) which is considerably cheaper than ordering a la carte. \u00a0The menu was different than on my first visit, so I suggest visiting the website to see what items you might expect to find. \u00a0On the set menu, there are three choices for each of the courses (starter, main, dessert). \u00a0For the main dish, the options were beef, fish or vegetarian. \u00a0 There's a $15 option of adding a glass of wine and a $5 option for non alcoholic beverages.Because the menu changes, I won't comment on the food. \u00a0All of us had positive remarks on each of our dishes. \u00a0Whatever you decide to order, you can bet on 3 things:1. The plating and presentation will be flawless. \u00a0Everything is very beautifully arranged and presented on large oversized white plates or bowls.2. Every morsel will be delicious. (Enough said.)3. The portions will be small. \u00a0 If you sit down with a ravenous appetite, there's a good chance you'll leave a little hungry. No matter the course, when they serve you that enormous oversized white plate with the small beautiful portion of food in the middle, you'll be met with the bitter sweet realization that it will all be over in just \u00a05 or 6 bites. \u00a0We assume that if you order the same dish a la carte that the portion size will be larger. \u00a0 I am not sure.After the meal, you get complimentary entry into the Flower Dome. \u00a0Leaving the lower level restaurant, we took the elevator up to exit through the upstairs cafe. \u00a0 The elevator doors opened into the cafe and we were met with bright sunlight, loud families, and the hectic atmosphere of a theme park patio dining area. I say this to point out the difference between the fine dining lower level restaurant and the upstairs cafe. \u00a0I'm sure the upstairs is also nice, but it's two different experiences.The Good: The atmosphere, food and service. \u00a0Complimentary entry into the Flower Dome.The Bad: \u00a0Laughably (gourmet sized) small portions. \u00a0On our first visit we sat at the table next to the entry into the Flower Dome. \u00a0The massive aircon units for the Flower Dome must be nearby. \u00a0There was such a cold draft that we were all MISERABLE. \u00a0Chilled to the bone. They offer shawls for the ladies. \u00a0My recommendation is to bring a sweater.The Verdict: \u00a0I highly recommend Pollen for lunch or dinner. It's an especially nice place to bring out of town visitors. \u00a0 Make a reservation and arrive a little early to take the chauffeured buggy to the restaurant. \u00a0Leave yourself some time afterwards to stroll through the Flower Dome.","910":"This review is for lunch at Pollen's main dining room on the ground floor.* star Service\/staff -polished as well as professional service. Lots of attention. Always helpful.* star Location -Amazing Dome location. Free shuttle to restaurant. Free entry\/exit from garden. Amazing views of the city.* star Food- enjoyed my lunch. Presentation as well as flavor quite superb technically. Not a lot of food but I expected as much.* star Restaurant decor- uncluttered, sophisticated, airy, quiet. Kind of boring but I suppose the food is to be the star here. All in all a real yawner. Nothing too interesting or compelling about Pollen. I just cannot see me returning to the main dining room. Ever. Maybe I will try the upstairs cafe for a more casual experience with more casual prices.","911":"This is a review of the cafe, not the restaurant. Loved the high tea!! My mom came to town from nyc and I took her to gardens by the bay so we stopped by here for champagne and high tea. Surprisingly reasonably priced for everything you get. I got 2 glasses of champagne, a flower tea, and the small bites from 1 order of the high tea menu, all of which was more than adequate for my mother and I. I believe the bill came out to $80. Considering booze is expensive and Pollen is normally an expensive restaurant, I didn't think that was too pricey for 2 people with booze included. Definitely worth a try for the high tea menu!","912":"Horrible service. Extremely blur staff. My food is placed on the wrong table for a good 10 mins before the staff realised the mistake. And have the cheek to bring the food from the next table to mine. How would I know if the next table have eaten it or touched it? How unprofessional and unhygienic is that?When I confronted the staff, all she said was,\"it was a mistake\". I know it is a mistake. So correct it by giving us a new dish.","913":"Pollen is Michelin star Chef Jason Atherton's second venture in Singapore, following Esquina (read review here). It also is the second outlet of his London flagship restaurant, Pollen Street Social. The food here is supposed to be Mediterranean-inspired modern European cuisine but really, i don't see or taste the Mediterranean at all.Dinner started with 3 little amuse bouche, all of which distracted us from the important task of creating our menu for the night.Choux bun filled with cheese and truffle. Cracklings served with an apple puree and arancini (breaded rice ball with cheese) served with hummus. Adored the arancini with the creamy risotto style rice.Our starters:The Mosaic of foie gras and confit duck with cherries and tangy apple puree ($40) was quite different from the usual that is served with berries compote. I highly recommend the Trip to Japan 2012 ($38). Stellar succulent and sweet scallop sashimi were served atop marinated daikon in a lemony and saltish broth of sake and mirin. The sea urchin didn't make a difference to the overall dish. Kinda seemed like it was thrown in just to glorify the dish. More snow in this one (horseradish) but it melted when we were happily snapping away. The Scottish lobster ($55) was an elaborate dish. When it was served, we were wondering if we accidentally ordered extra food. This was a 3 course dish and it consisted of an intense lobster bisque, a lobster 'burger' and chilled lobster with fennel cream and sea urchin.Our favorite was the bisque which was served in a wine glass. Exactly the way it should be savored. Next was the burger was done a la atas lobster roll style but with a buttery brioche bun. These were way better than the tasteless rubbery lobster chunks that were served with fennel cream and sea urchin. Again, the sea urchin was purposeless. Our mains- Kurobuta pork belly, braised cheek, charred spring onions, butternut squash, Sudachi lime ($67). There was a great balance of fat and meat. Take away all the sides and you have pork belly done Asian way. This is really good roast pork with kong ba essentially. The caramelized and smokey leek with sweet pumpkin puree were great accompaniments. The overall dish was delightful with the various textures and flavors. Halibut ($70) was recommended by our server. This is a lightly flavored dish and i'm more a fan of strong flavors. Despite that, the simply pan fried fish held up on its own.We were stuffed but we had to have desserts to conclude our Pollen experience. We had the Pollen \"Tatin\" which was made of Verjusm creme fraiche, caramel jelly, red and green apples ($20). I'd much rather a pot of tea with their stellar petit fours. For that i had the moist matcha cake, perfect lime macaron, smooth coffee chocolate and a piece of candy to end the meal. Overall, the Pollen experience was great. Lovely ambience that was comfortable and cosy. Great service as well though they could be a little more attentive. Plus the food was pretty good too. Certainly would recommend Pollen for a special occasion.","914":"This is a review of a dinner date at Pollen.This was a very rainy night. \u00a0It took me a long time to get a taxi. \u00a0My dinner date was meeting me at the restaurant. \u00a0She was on-time. \u00a0The staff were very friendly in showing her to the upstairs bar area to await my arrival. \u00a0To get to Pollen, you go to the main entrance to Gardens by the Bay. \u00a0There is a shuttle that will pick you up and take you to the restaurant. \u00a0In my case, they knew my name and communicated to my date that I was on the shuttle. \u00a0By the time I arrived, she had come down from the bar area to our table.Ambiance - I think this is a impressive room. \u00a0It is not flashy but it is cleissic and modern. \u00a0The mirrors give it a feel of being larger than it is. \u00a0This is also accentuated by the large windows. \u00a0It is also not a restaurant steeped in darkness. \u00a0I am not sure why so many restaurants in Singapore keep the lighting so dark. \u00a0But the lighting at Pollen was nearly perfect.tinyurl.com\/a5olo25Service - I've already mentioned they were very nice and helpful with my dinner date. \u00a0Overall, the staff was professional and friendly. \u00a0During the initial set-up, \u00a0they were very attentive. \u00a0The meal flowed at a very even and measured pace. \u00a0However, mid-meal there was a lapse in attentiveness. \u00a0They also seemed to switch to different servers at different times and back again. \u00a0I prefer to have the same continuous server. \u00a0This way, I know who specifically to ask questions to.The food ranged from good to excellent.Olives and Pork Rinds - To start the meal, they provided olives and pork rinds. \u00a0I am not the biggest fan of olives. \u00a0I took a half-hearted attempt at one. \u00a0My dinner date did not even do this. \u00a0We did however both go right for the pork rinds. \u00a0As a US southern boy, pork rinds hearken to my youth. \u00a0Mmm, mmm fried pork skin with a dipping sauce.tinyurl.com\/a3m9te4tinyurl.com\/bkc83zjFallow deer tartare, pickled and salt-baked beetroot, smoked vinaigrette - This was her selection for a starter. \u00a0It was quite good. \u00a0The flavours came together so well. \u00a0If there was a weakness it was the pickled flavour was a touch too dominate. \u00a0The deer was extremely tender. \u00a0This was a very well presented dish. \u00a0Plus, I really enjoyed the textural contrasts.tinyurl.com\/ak4ohc4Trip to Japan 2012 (scallop sashimi, baby gem wasabi, sea urchin) - Using US sports metaphors, this was a home-run. \u00a0The scallops were perfect. \u00a0Then there was the urchin set against the sweetness of the scallops and the wallop of the wasabi and horseradish snow.tinyurl.com\/badefm6Cote de boeuf (1kg for two persons to share) - For our main, we shared the cote de boeuf. \u00a0This was a quality piece of beef. \u00a0It was relatively tender. \u00a0It was cooked to what I consider a perfect medium rare. \u00a0I could really taste the meat itself. \u00a0There was a slight oiliness though that did minimally detract from the steak. \u00a0tinyurl.com\/bycwoudDuck Fat Fries - We each were provided with our own cup of duck fat fries. \u00a0Well, it is thick cut fries cooked in duck fat. \u00a0What is your guess? \u00a0Yep, they were excellent. \u00a0Every meal should come with duck fat fries like these.tinyurl.com\/bed8pxkGreens - We were also provided with a lovely bouquet of greens. I say bouquet because we both treated them as a table decoration. \u00a0They went untouched. \u00a0They looked quite fresh but neither of us ventured to try them.tinyurl.com\/bzhe6g9Receipt (Dinner for two - $597.92)tinyurl.com\/aw68s25Overall - This was a very enjoyable dining experience. \u00a0The food was consistently well prepared. \u00a0While there were brief lapses, the service was professional, friendly, and helpful. \u00a0The room is one of my favourite thus far in Singapore. \u00a0There is always a fine line and it can be difficult to discern what separates four stars from five. \u00a0I truly like Pollen but I thought via a smidgen here and a smidgen there, that it fell just short of five stars. \u00a0I would certainly have no issue in returning to or recommending Pollen.","915":"Pollen is located in the Flower Dome but has its own separate entrance. The restaurant is two storeys and its the cafe upstairs that's in a corner of the Flower Dome. After a meal or high tea at Pollen, guests can wander into the rest of the Flower Dome and bypass the admissions charge. This is probably the only good thing I have to say about Pollen. I would liken this place to a F&B rest stop at a tourist attraction. Imagine you're at the local zoo and you're looking to sit down for a bit and enjoy and overpriced snack... that's what Pollen is. I can't believe this is a Jason Atherton restaurant. You should only come here if you've (1) had a long day at Gardens by the Bay, (2) intended to go into the Flower Dome and (3) wanted to have a snack or meal. I recently came here for their $38\/person high tea. Our waiter was brusque & inattentive. Everything was completely meh. The scones are dry and came with a smidgen of strawberry jam. Don't scones usually come with clotted cream or butter? I asked the waiter if he had clotted cream or butter. At first he looked shocked, and then he said he could get me butter like it was the first time he heard such an outrageous request. The tea came in a tiny teacup, no teapot in sight or any indication that they kept the teapots at the counter to refill your cup for you. What does it say about the service if the place is less than a quarter full and you need to ask if the tea is refillable because your cup is so small and has sat empty for 15 minutes? Of course I never ever give servers a hard time, I just nicely asked if my tea was refillable (because I would not have been surprised if it wasn't). Definitely won't be back.","916":"Kill two birds with one stone: complimantary entrance to the garden if you get the hightea.","917":"I am giving Pollen 5 stars because while it was not the most mind blowing meal by far, I \u00a0appreciate the fact that i can have this meal in Singapore at all. If we were closer to the source of the ingredients then i'm sure it will be that smidgen more magical. We had the 8 course menu and everything was tasty, some things weaker than others, but I can't cook like that, so it's not an issue to me.I am still giving it 5 stars despite the fact that the service was polite and blundering at the same time. They gave me extra pork crackling.I've heard bad things from people who have gone for lunch and if your experience of Pollen involves slumming it with the tourists on the upper deck of the restaurant on the frankly, hideous garden furniture, then perhaps there is no chance of redemption. I suspect that restaurants like these make a better effort at dinner time.So, top tip. Go for dinner, take your time, order the set menu, and if you do think its less than perfect, remember you are slap bang on the equator.","918":"The restaurant compares to any in NYC, SF, Chicago, LA etc. Very pretty setting, in the flower dome; free admission into the dome. The service in general was good except for a snooty local manager who all but rolled his eyes every time he talked to us. Honestly. Otherwise, attentive and top-notch service. We were here on Christmas Eve but managed to order from the ala carte menu. Each dish was meticulously crafted and delicious; it actually really reminded me of meals in SF (perhaps not quite Gary Danko, but certainly Spruce, Foreign Cinema etc.)Would recommend for a romantic or special occasion. Guaranteed to impress","919":"Having opened its door to the public on 29 June, 2012; this much anticipated restaurant - Pollen, is here to wow it's esteemed guests. The second restuarant in Singapore; Chef Jason Atherton of one Michelin-starred - Pollen Street Social, replicates its collection of modern European fare with a Mediterranean twist for diners to enjoy in a casual way. Some of the dish takes after his London resto; the popular ones are seen injected into the new Mediterranean eatery. I liked how the name integrate with its location, mimics a perfect match in heaven - Pollen @Flower Dome of Gardens By The Bay, some kind of a tailored business opportunity. Or was it a karma or faith to bring together?The 140-seater restaurant comes with 2 decks - the lower floor which is the dining area & dessert bar sits 80 diners while the upper level which serves as a bar area can accommodate another 60 guests exposed to the green foliage. I entered the restaurant via the Flower Dome as I have gotten a pair of tickets to both conservatories. In fact, you needn't buy the Flower Dome conservatory ticket to visit Pollen, just pop in by its ground level entrance which is accessible via the Gardens, free of charge. The best part, you still get to walk the Flower Dome after your meals, absolutely free paying - saving your $10 (Singaporean) - more bang for your buck! The furnishing and decor of the 2 decks were not identical. Very awe-inspiring and I get to enjoy both in a single dining.We started off with Salad of buttered lobster, pasta, seaweed (of which I opted out), maple dressing. A very refreshing salad with unpretentious sweet tangy seasoning, less of a maple flavour. The homemade pasta has an unusual texture of its own - flabby and soft noodles not the regular al dente that one would expect, nonetheless very gratifying. Then comes the sweet & succulent lobster meat, so fresh that you could smell the ocean breeze. Fighting against it, the baby Romanine was crisp to the core, served in total freshness.Scallop carpaccio, cucumber, apple, horseradish snow - much-hyped dish @London's Pollen street Social. What makes it such a hit? The modern culinary technique employed to make it stunning and pleasurable looking, along with the lingering taste it brought about. At one point, I'd thought that I am eating it alive - the raw scallop slices were meaty and tasted sweet which further accentuated by the vinaigrette dressing. Floral-inpired; the teaser was dressed up in colorful petals and dills, accompanied with the semi-frozen cucumber slices - as beautiful as its name sounds. I am so captivated by the horseradish 'snow' - using new culinary technique; where the buttermilk was added to horseradish juice & thickened with cornstarch, thereafter frozen and pacotized, and later grated microscopically when served. This dish is as pleasing to the palate as to the eyes, I am hoping for some headphones to come along soon. A total bliss out.\"PB&J\" - Peanut butter and cherry yuzu sorbet; topped the dessert list in London's flagship which I certainly wouldn't want to pass it up. Dreamy as it looked but serious in its taste! Sounds like a big diversion between the sweet peanut butter parfait & sour yuzu cherry sorbet, they duo did harmonize when eaten together. The after taste of yuzu has always been unique which I don't know what to make of it. Lara has been very creative when comes to plating - pomegranates, black raspberry & floral petals, everything looks so whimsical.","920":"This is my third time visiting pollen and I always like the ambience there. \u00a0I feel their Set lunch is more reasonable price and its a way to have a very relaxing day for a weekend. Services are great as usual and this is one of the places you should bring guests where aft meal you can stroll along flower dome. \u00a0 I do hope they'll tweak their menu a bit though as Im kinda know what I shall eat alrd.","921":"This place just opened 2 weeks ago at Garden By The Bay. It's really something. The location can be a bit far in, but looking out, you can see the Singapore Flyer, the Singapore River, and the City - it really is pretty romantic and all. There's a buggy service to get there and back - to the Bayfront MRT station, etc. I thought that was a fantastic idea. NOTE: Please make reservation!What I Love: The service. It was impeccable. The staff were very, very intuitive and sensitive. They came with olives and bread - as a starter. Then, the drinks list (omg, this list is somethin' else), as the cocktails are brewed are made in the restaurant. I started the night with 2 (and yes, no judgement please) and they were fab. Fresh, decorated very nicely - the attention to detail was amazing. In every drink, there was a little flower - keeping with the theme of Gardens By The Bay and the Pollen-concept. I had one which had carrot juice in it - the other one a passion fruit blend.The cutlery and furniture were sleek and cool.Okay, now to the main part of this review, the food! The starters and mains were to die for. Apart from 3-4 types of bread, olives and cod puree as a general starter, we also had Crispy Baby Squid and the Slow-cooked-egg-chorizo-patatas bravas. For our mains, I had the Pork Belly (OMG) and my date had the Sea-bass. All the options were yummy.All the other stuff in the menu looked good too - but I didn't wanna overeat.The restaurant also has a direct, private access to the Gardens By The Bay exhibit.What I Don't Love: Price? But I do think for the quality of the ambiance, food and service, this place is okay. It will set you back at least $80-$100 per person. I know. (I'm just glad I didn't pay for that meal. Haha!)","922":"Rang Mahal is an ultra modern yet classy Indian restaurant on the third floor of the Pan Pacific hotel. My girlfriend and I joined for a nice Sunday DINNER and were immediately taken away by the incredible ambiance from the moment we walked through the dramatic hallway entrance.We sat down and were again in awe over the high ceilings and Indian music subtly playing in the background, feels very zen-like.Service was quick and friendly, helped us out with recommendations. We ended up ordering:1) Murgh Makhni - Their version of butter chicken which is very well done.2) Prawns (don't remember what it was called) - I initially thought it was prawns cooked in the tandoor oven by itself which it is but also they add this sauce to it which tasted like I'm eating chinese food. The prawns were amazingly cooked and had great flavor but the sauce took a lot away for me.3) Paneer Tikka - Their Indian cheese dish - extremely well done. Loved it.4) Pani Puri - They had these Indian street food snack items as appetizers. Loved it!!5) Plain naan and rice - fluffy naan and rice was great. We ordered just enough not to get overly stuffed. Then for dessert, we ordered:1) Rasmalai - these cheese dumplings soaked in a milk type liquid. Indian staple dessert. It was ok.2) Gulab Jaman - best described as cake balls soaked in a sugary type liquid. Another Indian staple dessert, this was well done.3) Fig Kulfi - Indian ice cream with fig flavor. Surprisingly really good.The mango and sweet lassis both were pretty typical that you would find at any Indian restaurant. Always refreshing to get masala chai tea anywhere.The setting at this restaurant was on point and the food was very good. I would recommend this place over any other Indian restaurants in Singapore by far.","923":"Overpriced for what it is. This is one of the highest end Indian restaurants in a convenient Area of town for people who do not wish to Journey to little India. However for the price this place has some of the most average food that you will find. The presentation is awesome however the taste leaves much to be desired. For literally 1\/20 of the price I found a place near my office that delivered amazing Indian food. I will not be back to this establishmet for dinner again. Have been here for the lunch buffet as well and that is a far better deal and worth going to.","924":"Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and classiest Indian dining rooms I have seen. Unfortunately, the food - while good - is not great. If Dum Pukht in Delhi is a 10, this would be s 6. In fact, even in Singapore, Punjab Grill at MBS or The Song of India by an alum of Rang Mahal are better! Extremely expensive at SGD110 Per PAC for lunch before alcohol.","925":"Starter was a little cube of watermelon and a cube of coconut water soaked bread and a little shit of coconut water, tandoori chicken piece was tender, small shush kebab and a small vegetarian samosa, followed by a scoop of lemon sorbet. \u00a0Main course was rice with small chicken tikka masala, fish curry, Dahl, rice and dried okra. Desert was a very sweet coffee ice cream.The place is nice, service is good, the food was good, but not amazing.","926":"I probably am contradicting myself BIG TIME when I say this bc I love great hole-in-the-wall restaurants, but I am super picky when it comes to the establishments from which I get my share of delicious Indian cuisine. D and I love Indian food, but those curries in hawker centres or even the cheap $15 buffets seem very questionable. Perhaps its the sauce and spice-rich nature of Indian dishes that make me question whether a bug or two in an unsanitary kitchen haven't accidentally fallen and dissolved into its goodness. Sorry! that was disgusting. So here's Rang Mahal, an authentic, high-end Indian restaurant in Singapore that is delicious, clean, and superb in its service. On weekend lunch it becomes a buffet, at $50\/person from 12pm-2pm, serving you a wide variety of Indian cuisine. The interior here is serene and simple, exactly as you would expect from a fine dining restaurant. I marked off one star for charging me $10 bucks for one glass of coke, without refills! I do not support such shady tactics to rip more money away from its (loyal, or soon to be loyal) customers. Other than that, I'm a fan.","927":"Expensive but pretty good food. Great vegetarian choices and huge wine list. All of the food was fantastic except the subtz which was a bit oily. Service was excellent and background music was suitable Indian origin. We would go back as it's in my TOP 5 Indian restaurants in Singapore.","928":"Here for the lunch buffet. \u00a0Great value. \u00a0A very good assortment of foods with 3 protein and many vegetarian options. \u00a0There is an appetizer station, mains selection and a great dessert bar. \u00a0It was nice that not all desserts were Indian and there are French style desserts from the talented pastry chefs at Pan Pacific. \u00a0The service is excellent. Very attentive. \u00a0Some of the best in the city.","929":"Successful tinkering with traditional Indian dishes. Most delish and the cooking is done with a light hand so you don't feel too bogged down after a meal.Love the pappadum basket with the various flavours - the black pepper one packs a sneaky heat and the one with fennel and cumin is very addictive. The quinoa is the best quinoa I've ever tasted. And the artichoke pakora is lovely despite the unexpected vegetable. The seafood is cooked a bit unevenly although the spicing levels are perfect. But it's a minor quibble. The service is a bit lacking for a restaurant of this caliber. There were quite a few waiters hustling around but it took effort to get them to come take our orders and to get their attention to pay the bill. And when my friend and I arrived, there was no one manning the podium out front. They need to brush up on that aspect of their restaurant. Great twist on familiar favourites. I'll be back to try the brunch buffet","930":"Probably the best Indian and one of the best restaurant in Singapore. Service is excellent","931":"there are few places that do indian fine dining... and even fewer that do it well. in my limited repertoire of indian fine dining places, rang mahal ranks very much at the top. judging by the loyal followers that have poured in after the panpac's location renovation - i guess quite a number of people agree.there is a lunch buffet that allows you to try an array of items. all still exquisitely done with the same attentive service. about $50 a pop? i am a huge truffle fan and was pleased to find truffle naan on the menu... truffle and carbs... a dream come true!must also highlight that they have a lovely private dining room for parties big enough (10 maybe? call and check) and a great outside patio area to chillax with a cuppa masala tea after you are done. vansh (at stadium walk, also under the rang mahal group) is actually my preference between the two. however i couldn't find vansh listed on yelp despite it having been around for about 6 years now?love.","932":"Expensive and okay. Just not fantastic. Started with veggie samosas which were tasty. \u00a0Had the palak paneer which had no taste. \u00a0Also had the aloo gohbi which had a nice flavor . \u00a0The naan was good as it should be.","933":"My favorite Indian restaurant outside of India. Very authentic food. The ambiance is classy. A fine dining experience; one of the priciest Indian restaurants I have been to. Desert is great. I go there for the Sunday brunch. Make sure to make a reservation.","934":"Impeccable service and delicious food. Roland and his team elevate the Singapore seafood dining experience. Conveniently located on the East Coast on the top floor of the parking garage next to the Marine Parade NTUC Fair Price, dine on local favourites like chili and pepper crab, crunchy baby squid and stuffed dough sticks (yew char kway). First, the nosh. I enjoyed the flavourful boiled peanuts with black bean and sesame tones offered instead of the usual roasted kachang (roasted peanuts). They asked if we wanted tea. (Tip: They do not have chrysanthemum tea.) We decided to stay with water instead. They brought out an extensive menu filled with Chinese seafood dishes that I grew up with when I used to visit Seafood Road on East Coast Road (Long Beach, Palm Beach, Redhouse, nearby Golden Lion). I was transported back in time. They have lovely pictures in the menu that helped with my decision-making process. We ordered two large male crabs: chili crab and pepper crab, market price was $72 per kilogram. It was more than $10 less that the market price at restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Center. The chili crab sauce was to die for. We sopped it up with fried and steamed mantou (slightly sweet bread). The black pepper crab was tasty. The crab meat was sweet and tender, but I have had crab that was fatter and more meat. However, it could've been a seasonal thing. They might've just finished moulting. \u00a0The fried baby squid was heavenly. These half inch long morsels are sweet and savouring, serving up a distinct flavour and crunch. I felt sad that I didn't eat another plateful. Try it with a red chili sauce. Sweet and heat, Bobby Flay would've been proud.Another dish that had the sweet and heat thing going on was the fish paste stuffed fried dough stick (stuffed yew char kway). These come out hot and crispy. The fish paste was delicious. Dip it into the sweet flour and chili sauce that was hmmm, so good. My daughter licked it clean. They'd probably given us more sauce of we'd asked.Our last course was fried rice with tiny silver fish and crab. This dish was full of texture. I loved the crispiness of the fried fish that made the dish pop. I thought the crab was a little lost in the dish, but I enjoyed two bowls of it. I enjoyed eating it was a lightly seasoned plate of kailan greens.Just went I thought I could eat no more, they brought out orh nee, a traditional Teochew dessert or sweet taro paste. Unlike other orh nees that is sticky and oily, Roland's rendition is lighter and smoother, still maintaining its characteristic sweetness and slightly floral notes. My daughter enjoyed the light mango pudding with pomelo. That capped the evening on the highest note. It is one of the loveliest mango concoctions I have ever tasted. My daughter shyly asked for another round.While thinking about the food again makes me salivate, what sets Roland's apart is their service. When we made inquiries about the menu, the staff were friendly and hospitable, taking the time to go to the kitchen to answer our questions. When we made our reservations over the phone, they continued their extend their warm hospitality. Upon arrival, the maitre d' had our reservation on her list, then ushered us to a beautifully set smaller round tables. Roland's is a fantastic place to hold a banquet. The beautiful dining room is beautifully decorated with mirrors and lit low. The lights in the tanks added ambiance. Also, the restaurant is quieter than typical Chinese restaurants and conducive to conversations. The waitstaff were so attentive throughout the meal that I almost felt like I was at a French restaurant. Okay, I exaggerate a little, but still, they were super attentive and accommodating. It was a little surreal to be attended so closely while peeling and sucking on crab shells at the same time. However, I got over it very quickly. We couldn't finish our orh nee, and the wait staff quickly offered to package it home in a doggie bag for us. We all enjoyed our dining experience.Try Roland's for classy and comfortable way to enjoy Singapore seafood!","935":"Singapore is know for many things, chili crab being one! Roland is a Singapore institution that is popular amongst the locals.As others have said, compared to other places, Roland's crab is more \"spicy\" than sweet, catering to a more authentic taste than other places that tend to have more of a tourist crowd. That said, I really enjoyed the chili crab and the group I was with ordered another!The atmosphere is nice - it's not overdone and you feel that you're in a \"Chili Crab\"\/Asian restaurant rather than some tourist joint. it's hard to describe, but once you look at the photos you'll understand. It has a really strong family vibe and, if you come late enough, you might be lucky to hear terrible Cantonese\/Mandarin karaoke next door which only makes the experience feel more authentic!English is a bit hit and miss with some of the staff but it's manageable.","936":"Roland is the FOUNDER of Singapore's famous Chilli Crab. It's hard to imagine that this is indeed the case when you have other more known establishments such as Jumbo Restaurant, No Signboard Seafood, and Long Beach Seafood spread across the Red Dot. Make no mistake about it, however, this is one of the BEST places to grab Chilli Crab in Singapore. Located on top of a parking lot!?!? This is where the locals, particularly those who live in the East, get their Chilli crab. In terms of the Chilli Crab itself, I'll second what a fellow Yelper said in her review. Roland delivers a Chilli Crab that is more chilli than sweet, the way it ought to be done. Many restaurants cook their Chilli Crab in order to cater to a foreigners' sweet tooth (ahem, Jumbo). I wouldn't say the dish is spicy, but it did have some kick resulting a little bit of sweat coming down my forehead. :DThe other dishes were solid. The Baby Kai Lan was absolutely delicious, while the Seafood Food Fried Rice came up way short (I wasn't a big fan of the crunchy like topping they sprinkled on the Fried Rice).Overall, if you are a big fan of Chilli Crab, Roland is a must try!","937":"I have always wanted to try the Chilli crab that started all Chilli crabs but no chance till now! My best friends returned home from overseas and demanded to fulfill their Chilli crabs need. So I suggested to try Roland Restaurant, I mean they DID claim that they are the originator!! As the star dish of the night, I must say that their Chilli crab is indeed better than most I have eaten. This is because many restaurants cater to foreigners' taste buds and scale down their Chilli-ness to tomato sweet. Their sauce is thick with a hint of tomato sweet and yet still packed with even Chilli punch! Awesome!!!! The crabs themselves were fresh and meat was juicy and firm. Another star of the night has to be the Salted Egg Crab with yam. It's really salted egg sauce that's fried into the crab and they tossed in some yam fritters to give the dish extra crispiness, crunch and flavor!!! We had many other dishes and all beautifully done. As my best friend said at the end of the meal, \"Roland knows how to do it right\". The meal is not cheap but we had Sea Bass and drunken prawns and Broccoli with Scallops so it's rather worth the cost. Definitely bringing my family to try.","938":"Wah. The customer service here is really crazy. By crazy I mean good crazy. They are so attentive to clear your plates and top up your tea, but its not like I feel them hovering around my table all the time and spying on me.Probably they have some CCTV somewhere to secretly monitor our dining? Hahaha. Got crab and kai lan. Both were ridiculously delicious. But the calories should be insane since they put so much ingredients into the crab.Only caveat is that it's kinda ex.. But oh wells...","939":"Very tasty chilli crab, it is 800 gr and good for two person. (55 Sin. Dol.) Crispy noodles with prawns is also very good and really tasty. I will try there dim sum also during noon time.","940":"The restaurant is an institution in this island nation and they are the original creators of Singapore's famous Chilli Crabs! A must try for all seafood lovers! And good value for money!The restaurant is simply decorated but most diner are there concerned only with the excellent food that they serve and not the decor. They have an extensive menu that is sure to satisfy most! So if you're visiting Singapore and looking for a great meal this is one restaurant that you cannot afford to miss!!","941":"The best chili crabs i have ever eaten! There is thus black sauce prawns dish that simply delectable! I have tried their other crab dishes and i have to say they are really so delicious too!","942":"A big restaurant perfect for families and large groups. Very sweet chilli crab for S$60 per kg. We took some veggies and fried baby squid as side dishes. Although the chilli crab is a bit expensive it is worth its money. The sauce was very nice to add with steamed rice and the buns.","943":"Pretty good, comparable Chinese food back home, even though I was here for a baby's one month lunch buffet celebration, impressed w\/ the noodles, pan-fried shrimp, stuffed tofu, and the chicken.Apparently known for its seafood & crab, not exactly the food of choice with babies and kids running around.Dessert pudding with the tapioca, was average since I prefer this more of a jello-feel, as this one's more of a soup.Massive restaurant, easily 300 seats, with plenty of private room action.Service quite impressive, as they topped up our glasses.One minor criticism is its lighting, not exactly the brightest.","944":"I'll keep this review simple. As expected, the chili crab is excellent, and you should definitely order some fried mantous to soak up the sauce. The attire is casual, and you should probably wear some old clothing you don't care about getting messy. Alternatively, you and your friends can wear white t-shirts and use each other as napkins.","945":"I came here with my classmates and everyone of us enjoyed the place and its food. We ordered the duck, black pepper crab, longevity noodles, Golden Beancurd, Teochew Steamed Seabass. I hope that my classmates and I can have a reunion here sometime into the future!","946":"Picture yourself sinking your teeth into juicy, succulent and flavourful steaming crab flesh imbued with spices, and then swabbing the thick chilli gravy with chewy fried mantous (deep fried buns). The star dish for Singaporean cuisine lands at a respectable 35th position in CNN's World's Top 50 Most Delicious Foods (ousting his yummy cousin, the chicken rice, by 10 spots). If you're out for a big treat, Roland's the place to go!","947":"Handmade fishballs and fishcake that my mom exclaimed - taste like Ah Po's (grandma's ) Rated top 10 in singapore but I think it is one of the top 3. The noodles and chilli isn't the best but the fish ball and fishcake is, in my opinion.","948":"The Blk 44 Holland Drive market has reopened! Along with this yummy fishball noodle stall!I believe it is the Sambal Chilli that maketh a great bowl of noodles. And Ru Ji makes theirs right. Not forgetting their QQ fishballs too! If I'm not wrong, they make their own fishballs too. Many fishball stalls don't make their own fishballs anymore, they just buy from factories which are just not the same.","949":"Be prepared to queue for Ru Ji's fish ball noodles, and do not be surprised if you are at least number eight in line even if its early in the morning around 7am. My parents are totally devoted to this stall, and claim that this is the only place where fishball noodles should be eaten. For just $3, enjoy the soft and not \"fishy\" fish balls, the noodles well-mixed with a generous serving of chili, and the soup served with delicious fish cakes. Highly recommended!!! Opening hours: Mon-Sat 7am-1pm, Sunday closed","950":"This restaurant has moved to One Fullerton, please check their website. This restaurant serves nice French food. They provide 3 kinds of lunch set menu, differentiated by the price, $58, $85, and $100 ++, wine not included. Very nice food, nice scenery overlooking Marina Bay Sands building and Singapore river. Perfect and proper service. A must try when in Singapore.","951":"One of the most disappointing starred restaurant we have dined at. While food was good, as it should be at an establishment such as this, the service was shockingly dismal. For starters, they forgot to omit an ingredient one of our party was allergic to, even after we specified before dinner started. No apology given other than blaming it on the kitchen who forgot. In one instance, when the dish was set, an uncomfortably long silence ensued, and the waitstaff took the menu and just read it. The desserts were served exceedingly slowly. We saw that they came out of the kitchen and was waiting to be served to our table. When they finally arrived after about 5 minutes just sitting at the side, all the dry ice (and the effects of the dry ice) was gone, leaving behind a pool of water!In addition, kitchen staff engaged with friends from the table directly behind us. For 45 minutes, they were standing, talking loudly, and milling about behind our table. It was uncomfortable as the restaurant space was small. We understand that diners want a good time, and tables may be noisy at times. However, that this was instigated and sustained by a staff member at the expense of other diners is unacceptable.When feedback was offered at the end of the meal, the chef was not interested and asked if he could leave the conversation. The front of house staff called the next day after reviewing the video from the camera at the restaurant. They did offer to send a cake and flowers to the person we were celebrating for, but we felt service recovery was poor, especially after the fact that they were uninterested the night before. We declined their offer for the cake and flowers. Will not return as there are many options elsewhere with better food and service.","952":"amazing japanese snow crab with muskmelon and watermelon, a french-japanese joint that actually works","953":"shangri-la fancy dining. business dinner with delicate dishes, enjoyed the vermicelli claypot with seafood and crunch.","954":"Mesmerizing Chinese cuisine, you breathe it in while you eat it. Some spicy szechuan or wok fried meat and seafood but delicately so, also steamed fish or stewed duck, roasted chicken or wagyu beef or braised pork or, baked lambshank, crispy noodles or vermicelli noodles, dumplings, and lots of claypot items. The staff serves you new Jasmine tea anytime you're less than half-full on your cup -- they are serious about keeping you replenished. Sophisticated families eat here, and I imagine all appreciate it. Bill quickly goes upwards -- do it anyway, you will recover financially later. #inside-shangri-la-hotel","955":"One of the Japanese stalwarts in Singapore, frequented by Japanese expats and those with 2 hour lunch breaks because that's about how long you need to enjoy the Sushi course that everyone orders. It's $120 and it used to be less back when inflation wasn't so crazy but at least you're paying for good edomae sushi and it's cheaper than flying to Tokyo for Sushi Sho. As this was a business lunch, I couldn't take any pictures or mentally note down my thoughts on the food (yes I wish I was that good at multi-tasking but this brain is aging).I thought the meal as a whole was pleasant, service was well paced and we tried a decent range of sushi. The meal started with a delicious Japanese tomato cut like a flower, which put a smile on my face. We also had some pickled shellfish that I couldn't quite make out but it was fresh, firm and tasty. For the main sashimi and sushi courses, the former had the standard Singapore crowd-pleasing fishes while the sushi was more interesting. There seemed to be a skew towards red and white fish, which could be due to seasonality or the chef's preference. If I'm not mistaken, there was shima-aji (amberjack) with ginger and kisu (whiting) as well as a fairly balanced and sweet chutoro; along with standards like cucumber and tamago. The soup was great too. In all, the meal was elegant, simple and light, which is great for lunch.","956":"This restaurant serves very good original Japanese taste. Very nice and delicious sashimi and sushi. Home processed ikura was very special with amazing texture and taste. Very good fried and simmered food as well. Good, kind and helpful service. This is an up market restaurant so higher prices were expected but it was well worth it.","957":"Keep moving. Very average, but then again maybe it's because I just came in from Tokyo. I have never met a less engaged sushi chef. \u00a0Fish fresh but average.","958":"Unforgettable Chinese fine-dining, at incredibly affordable prices with impeccable service.We ordered the weekend brunch menu ($65 sgd pax, incl tea\/tax\/service), which was a fantastic mix of dishes. The opening dim sum highlight was the crispy prawn. The duck was as good as any I've had in China.The soup was moreish, but not too rich. The stir fried prawns were huge and succulent, in a delicious sauce. The Mapo Doufu was to perfection - not too overwhelming, but spicy enough, and was well balanced with the riceThe desserts were not too special, but for $65, we'd already committed daylight robbery. Will be back!","959":"Excellent food, with 2 Michelin Star quality, served gracefully. The price is actually surprisingly low for the type of location and of food! Probably one of my best meals in Singapore.","960":"This is a nice restaurant located high above Singapore at 35 storeys of the Emeritus Mandarins. The decorations looks fantastic, with chandeliers and oriental furniture. The service was good - quick to attend to you, but somewhat lacking. For example they did not change your plate but you can get new plates from the buffet area. So far the place is great, the decorations are very nice , the service could be better and the important reason we are here.... The food is so-so. We had the dim sum buffet. The normal run of the mill prawn dumplings, stewed chicken feet, Char siew pow, etc. Unfortunately the steamed pork rib and stewed chicken feet was dry probably over steamed. The fillings of the pau was also dry. I expected better given the class of this restaurant. You get to order a soup each l had the corn Alaskan crab soup, three signature dishes - they were mostly good, and a dessert. You can get more dessert at the buffet area but the ordered dessert was excellent. Appetizers are available at the buffet area. Free flow of dim sum in additional to those ordered items.The ordered dishes were ok not great. The dim sum were so so only. The dessert was excellent.Given that this is a Japanese Chinese cuisine , it just not as good as pure Chinese cuisine.","961":"I am a HUGE fan! The fact that it never gets crowded even during lunch\/dinner time makes it even better (I still book it pre-arrival just to be safe though). I am not from Sichuan but it is definitely one of my most favorite Chinese cuisines, so we have looked almost all over Singapore for authentic Sichuan food at a decent place. That means the food has to be mostly hot as blazes from Sichuan peppers, which are different from chili peppers. It will still wither your mouth but these peppers have a natural chemical that gives a little bit of numbness. I personally don't take extremely hot flavor on a daily basis or in general except for Sichuan food (by the way you can opt for less spicy).My faves:Spicy cold steamed chicken with cashew nuts $20Chen's Mapo Doufu $20 *perfect with Hokkaido riceStewed fish fillet in super-hot Szechwan pepper sauce $26Saut\u00e9ed chilli pepper and chicken $22I've tried many Sichuan restaurants in China as well as US and this is one of the restaurants that I have found really authentic. I've been going here for more than 10 times in less than a year. The interior is very beautiful and classy. Servers are attentive and the food is consistently high quality. This place is perfect for the atmosphere to impress a date or client especially if you know that they love real Sichuan food so much! Meals are a la carte in medium sizes to share mostly but they have three options for set menu that start from $68 per person. On a la carte section, one dish is typically $12-25 on average which I think is very affordable for the ambiance, location and food quality. If you order one per person and then share it's not hard to have a generous meal with some tasty leftovers to take home.","962":"Meh. Bearable if you're looking for somewhat fancy Cantonese food to dine with your Chinese in laws. Nothing special, nothing interesting, nothing creative -- think \"braised abalone\" and \"XO\" dishes. There are a couple of Sichuan dishes on the menu that are mediocre imitations of the real thing.If you are forced to go, book a booth next to the skyline windows -- perhaps the only redeeming thing about this place. Otherwise, pass. And certainly don't buy into the hype about the founder and his father -- true or not, certainly doesn't show up in the food. There are far far better Sichuan places in SIngapore ....3 stars, which is very generous.","963":"Although touted as a purveyor of Japanese-Sichuan cuisine, the fare at Shisen Hanten is very simply, Sichuan fare, made just a little more refined and nuanced by the quintessential Japanese precision.The extensive menu is a tad daunting, and while we loved almost everything we ordered, it wasn't a 100% hit-rate, but a tip is to stick to the traditional stuff for a slamdunk meal.We had:1) Cold Steamed Chicken ($22) - seasoned with sesame and leek oil: incredibly aromatic, and despite subtle kick of the chilli pepper spice, was clear and refreshing. This was like Hainanese chicken, but all shredded up and given a spicy twist. Absolute must try.2) Grilled Wagyu Beef ($30): beautifully burnished and glossed with a delicate garlicky spice blend. Sumptuous, albeit forgettable. The earlier starter really stole the limelight. 3) Hot & Sour Soup ($12): exceptional, punchy and robust, but finished with an exquisite polish 4) Braised Corn Soup with Crabmeat ($12): skip this, it was insipid and clunky.5) Roasted Crispy Chicken ($46 for whole and promotionally half-priced on Thursday lunches): outstanding. For once, I actually only ate the breast meat, which was wonderfully moist and flavoursome6) Sweet & Sour Pork with Black Vinegar ($26): A galfriend thought it was \"too porky\", but I thought it was acceptably full-bodied. The one thing we all could agree on, was that the heady, sweetish, piquant glaze was absolutely delightful.7) Chen's Mapo Doufu ($22): hearty but restrained. I liked the complex nuance finessed into this.8) Rice Vermicelli with Crabmeat ($28): The noodles were lush with stock, but managed a light elegance; and it was generously piled with scallops, shitmeiji caps, freshly shredded crabmeat and egg white scramble","964":"Excellent food quality, nice decor n ambience, not so expensive food at all. I had their pipa duck, chicken w chilli n pepper, bbq pork bun, siumai, mapotofu, and kurobuta dumpling which all turned out very yummy. I saw some other table ordering other type of duck dishes as well, which I supposed to be their specialty perhaps ?","965":"When you see the chef hand-slicing the delicately pickled ginger and hand-grinding wasabi rhizome, you know you're in for an experience.Prepaid reservations required, although they refund the deposit and just charge the whole thing at the end. The restaurant seats all of eight people, although most of the action is closest to one side, so four people get the full experience before their eyes, the others have to glance to the left more.Everything is artfully done. Appetizer of baby corn, greens, and itty bitty fish is followed by a sashimi plate-- in this case was geoduck (?), flounder, and a superb jack mackerel. Uni atop botan ebi followed, holy crap-- so good. Next was a golden eye snapper with ponzu and what seemed like some sort of chopped veggie (almost like pico de gallo) atop, showing some innovation.Singapore's claim to fame, hair crab quarter, deliciously stuffed was next. Almost but not quite mind blowing. A very standard sea bream was next... don't let standard fool you, just because everyone does it, it's still good. Next was a crab (?) or something, I forget. Lightly grilled, very nice compared to the typical raw. Grilled sabrefish was unique and a very pleasant addition. Might have been a spanish mackerel next, I'm ashamed to say I didn't write it down! Mantis shrimp was another new one, I don't know if it was stuffed with something or it was how mantis shrimp is, but this was the one dish that was different that I didn't care for. Three different courses of tuna followed-- maguro, chutoro, and a charcoal-seared otoro. All very, very good. Watching your otoro seared before your eyes with real charcoal (!!!).A gentle palate cleanser next, although some might find it a bit strong. Baby tomato, okra, not sure what else.Cooked shrimp mixed things up, then a plate of both cooked abalone and clam, with yuzu pepper. I don't normally care for abalone, but this was excellent. Catfish (?) atop rice came next, quite a bit more delicate than I normally take for catfish. Long spike uni followed-- YUM, although the combination dish of ikura and uni that followed was even better-- almost perfect, and the ikura wasn't too salty, as so many places make the mistake.A clam miso soup was delicate but perhaps the most out of character thing, for some reason the clam-iness didn't do it for me either. A brilliant sweet tamago followed, then a chopped tuna\/shiso leaf\/brown rice hand roll just to keep your palate rolling!The real desert finally came, I think it was a lightly glazed honeydew and cantaloupe. Delicious.Some complain about service being a little sterile, and to be fair, it is. They greet you by name upon entrance and everything is entirely proper, so I wouldn't complain too much-- but then when you're dining at a 2* establishment and paying this kind of money, I fully understand the complaints.In the end, it's an easy rating on Yelp. You can get almost as good for half the money, though, and that is definitely a thought that weighs heavily enough to prevent Shoukouwa from getting a 5-star Yelp rating.","966":"Shoukouwa has a lot to live up to, famously earning two Michelin stars in a span of a few months after starting operations in April 2016. And I'm afraid it didn't live up to those expectations. I had dinner on a weekday evening. Reservations had to be secured with a credit card booking - pre paid. There were two options for dinner: $320 vs the pricier $480. We opted for the former. Which included:- appetizer of stewed grated yam with shirako in it (for the uninitiated, shirako is cod sperm. And it's in season!)- steamed crab with its roe and guts, dipping sauce of vinegar lime with sharks fins (!!! )- filefish sushi with its liver atop it- buri sushi- steamed sea perch with chopped scallions and garlic(?) in light soy sauce - baby shrimp sushi (can't recall its Japanese name)- shima aji sushi- grilled kinmedai- akami zuke (marinated maguro) sushi - chutoro sushi- aburi chutoro sushi (yes, with coals, not a blow torch)- persimmon in sesame paste palate cleanser- deep fried file fish in dashi broth- mategai sushi (most likely but can't be absolutely certain it was mategai and not another type of clam)- sayori (needlefish) sushi- sawara (Spanish mackerel) sushi. Lightly smoked. - murasaki uni sushi - anago sushi - miso soup- \"maki\" of sorts of toro and chopped scallions- rice dish of uni, ikura and caviar on uni mixed rice- Japanese fruits : melon and pearSo, interspersed with the sushi dishes were cooked seafood dishes. The shari was perfect, spot on. Yes for some of the fish it was vinegared with red darker ones, for the lighter white fish sushi, \"normal\" vinegar was used. Whatever it was, it had the perfect mix of stickiness and bite. To be honest there was nothing to fault re: the sushi. Each was made with the right amount of shari, packed with just the perfect firmness, brushed with soy sauce, use your fingers and enjoy! Hmm!The cooked dishes were mostly good except the kinmedai, which I felt was a waste to have it cooked -- with a sweet miso sauce I think. It was just, ok. Shoukouwa, in my opinion, pales in comparison with Shinji and Hashida (I have yet to try Sushi Ichi). Both Shinji and Hashida exude warmth-- in the decor, of warm wood and colours and large cypress wood table top and lighting, and service from both staff and sushi chefs. Shoukouwa was very masculine. Granite walls and some wood. Lighting wasn't warm. Not one staff (visible to customers at least) was female -- ok, not that it really matters, but one of the wait staff (the only non Japanese) \u00a0wasn't spot on 100% warm and friendly, look-in-the-eye professional service type one would expect. The seating of the restaurant meant that only a lucky two or four at most would get the best seats, watching the chef prepare the sushi. The other four (it was only a 8 seater long counter) would be watching quite faraway. I was seated right at the end, and right next to the curtain flap separating the kitchen. So yes, slightly noisy. There wasn't such an issue at Shinji or Hashida because of the design of the dining rooms. The sushi chef: there were two, one assisting the main. They were initially stern looking, not really being friendly other than the usual irrashimasu! I had to ask questions, about sushi, the chunks of fish, how long they were marinated or aged for, etc, before they became just slightly friendlier. Still not great. It's like as if they were reluctant to chat. Part of the experience at a sushi ya is watching the chef prepare the fish and sushi etc. there has to be a grace, even if there were more customers. He became hurried, and tossed some fish chunks into the boxes etc to get the sushi made. And that affected the speed at which our sushi was presented. Too quickly. I suppose it is a good thing we didn't have to wait too long for the next course, etc, and most of the time it was fine, but sometimes the sushi was presented one after another. I barely had time to have a piece of ginger before the next sushi was made and it just had to be eaten immediately! So these few negatives detracted from the experience. Which was otherwise good: Ocha (during meal) and houjicha (during dessert) were perfect complement to the food, the tamago was probably the best I've ever had, the sushi were all delicious -- I particularly enjoyed the akami zuke, the buri, filefish, and the uni dishes. But would I return? No. Would I recommend a meal at Shoukouwa? No. please have a meal at Shinji or Hashida instead. For the same price, it is much better there than Shoukouwa. I don't understand the Michelin stars at all. I award shoukouwa three stars because of the price, and the Michelin stars. If it was unstarred and slightly less pricier, it would have achieved a 4. Still not a 5.","967":"We had the top hana omakase dinner, and while the food wasn't bad, there was not a single wow dish!! Unimpressive sake list compared to others. Worse, the waiter spilled boiling water over a guest, and they couldn't offer him some cream or a spare shirt. Michelin inspectors are not equipped to judge Asian restaurants (or was there some conflict of interest?), because there are at least seven sushi\/Japanese restaurants in Singapore that are better than shoukouwa: the two Shinjii's, Hashida, Ichi, Ashino, Ki-sho, Waku-ghin (not exactly a sushi specialist, this one). At this price, more like a two-star on the Yelp scale than Michelin scale!","968":"This place definitely deserves a visit only because of how VINTAGE everything looks. You will feel like you've time travelled to the 80s with this place.It is also situated at the outskirts of Singapore's famous red light district. The food is bound to be good!Famous for the duck rice in this coffeeshop as well as the turtle soup, it is a very popular lunch time destination. The duck rice is really delicious as the rice is brown with herbal sauces and the duck meat tender and succulent on top of a bed of other items like egg, beansprouts and other assorted food. The turtle soup was surprisingly normal tasting, much like a black chicken soup. The turtle meat also.. tastes like chicken, even though there are bits of gelatinous skin in there which I did not touch.","969":"My 2nd time here eat their rice. 1st of all, the price is reasonable.The chicken meat was soft but more of a powdery texture which is different than the usual chicken rice meat.Now the rice is a bit grainy & not enough flavour of the authentic chicken rice.On both the meat & rice, it was not to my liking. Maybe others may like their style of the cooked chicken rice.","970":"Fantastic value Dim Sum. 30 SGD each for delicious fluffy pork buns, fantastic turnip cake and delicious Sichuan dumplings. The truffle spring rolls were a surprise hit. The prawns with wasabi were on point. The Mango deseet was nothing special, but the Egg Yolk Custard Buns were special.Topped off by impeccable service and daylight robbery prices - would absolutely recommend.","971":"The d\u00e9cor at Four Seasons or Regent hotels is always understated but elegant; here, it is quite dated, so the dining room looks more comfortable than smart. The dim sum menu is short but has many innovative dishes, like squid ink dumplings. No major creation in the \u00e0 la carte menu, but even simple dishes like fried rice (we had the 8 treasures variety) and crispy chicken are prepared with refinement. Service is courteous, but not terribly pro-active.","972":"2014.03.17American Express Restaurant Week.Summer Palace.Lunch Menu.This is my first time visiting the restaurant and I went with my wife and 18 month old daughter to have lunch.Service was excellent throughout the lunch. \u00a0Hostess remembered our names. \u00a0The service team covering our table was prompt and polite and is experienced and confident enough to introduce the dishes as they came as well as making polite conversation. \u00a0The team looks to be very experienced and table service was rendered with minimum fuss and complete professionalism.Tea. \u00a0We had the jasmine tea and it was very good. \u00a0There was a light but delightful fragrance and was very good value at S$3.00++ per pax.1st Course.Chef's Dim Sum Selection. \u00a0Pan-Fried Carrot Cake, Steamed Prawn Dumpling with Bird's Nest, Deep-Fried Prawn Rolls with MangoVery good. \u00a0I would come back to try the dim sum menu simply based on this course.2nd CourseDouble-Boiled Bamboo Pith Soup with Mushroom and Chinese CabbageVery well flavoured soup. \u00a0The Chinese Cabbage was very cooked to the point of being very tender but not yet mushy.3rd CourseBraised Homemade Beancurd with Crabmeat and Spinach.There was a very generous serving of crabmeat but the dish was very bland overall. \u00a0The very light flavours did not come together and the various ingredients tasted very one note. \u00a0There was also a hint of bitterness to the spinach.4th CourseBraised Ee Fu Noodles with LobsterI find that the lobsters I have here in Singapore tend to be cooked to the point of being chewy. \u00a0However, the half lobster that came with the dish was cooked just right, with the meat springy but not chewy. \u00a0The Ee Fu noodles was, unfortunately, very bland. \u00a0Compared to the Ee Fu Noodles served at Wo Pheng, which is delightfully infused with wonderful flavours, this is very poorly executed. \u00a0The kailan was simply boiled and served with the noodles and only adds to the overall blandness.5th CourseCombination Of Dessert. \u00a0Aloe Vera with Lemongrass. \u00a0Mango Sago. \u00a0Osthamus Wolfberry Jelly.I find the Mango Sago and Osthamus Wolfberry pretty much the same to what we would be able to get at any decent chinese restaurant. \u00a0However, the Aloe Vera with Lemongrass was very well executed and was very refreshing on the palate. \u00a0It was certainly the right note to end the lunch with and it left me feeling very much perked up and looking forward to the rest of the afternoon.","973":"I had the first of what will no doubt be many multi-course Chinese dinners for Chinese new year, at Summer Palace. This is an excellent, value-for-money Cantonese stalwart that has been around for years. I'm not sure why people would classify the restaurant as pricey when given the quality of the food, portions, decor and service, it really is the farthest thing from pricey. If one refers to the absolute price of the food, I think its a foregone conclusion when eating fine dining anything. Unless you catch your own abalone and other treasures yourself I guess... Anyway if that prevailing view works in my favor i.e. less people fighting for good seats in the house, I'm all ears :PWe had one of the set menu's (can't remember if it was peony or jade or something) and extended it to 8 people and swapped one of the dishes. It worked out to about $110 per person and we got:- suckling pig AND roast duck for starters- a brimming bowl of treasures each (diced abalone, ham etc soup with a very generous chunk of bird's nest on top)- broccoli with plump and juicy scallops kissed by XO and dried scallops- the best salted egg yolk prawns with asparagus - crunchy and rich without being overwhelming- a very fresh and large steam soon hock- light, but flavorful glutinous rice...annnnd nian gao + one of those light herbal jelly\/aloe vera type desserts to finish the feast. That's quite hard to beat. Barring some annoying tables nearby that were a tad loud, we had a very enjoyable meal and service was unobtrusive.","974":"Overall a pretty good experience. \u00a0Started with the suckling pig as a main event since it is my father in laws bday celebration. \u00a0This was followed with the crocodile with asparagus. \u00a0Really do taste like chicken unlike what we had in New Orleans. \u00a0Compliments to chef as obviously he does stir fry very well. \u00a0Pork rib with shrimp was delicious too. \u00a0Shrimp with salted egg was done just right. \u00a0Soon hock fillet with veg was also done very well. \u00a0Staff was efficient and lots of initiative seeing that my mother in law cold acted quickly to keep her warm. \u00a0My only wish was the food to come a little faster otherwise all good.","975":"Summer Palace is where you come to have high end Cantonese food. We made a reservation for two on a weekday and when we arrived, the attendant promptly ushered us to a window seat facing out into the Regent's swimming pool. We ordered the set meal at $62++ per person (minimum two persons) and was treated to a 6 course dinner. The menu included the typical cold plate for starters, birdnest soup with crab meat and dried scallop, veal meat, fish, lobster noodles and a light dessert of 3 tasting items. I have nothing bad to say about the food. The seafood was fresh, veal meat was tender and the birdnest just melted in my mouth! Love every bite of everything. Portion was just nice for us, if not a bit too much. They also have dim sum in the afternoon, for those who want some Chinese afternoon tea.Service was excellent. While it is a Chinese restaurant, they assigned an English speaking staff to us without prompting - most likely because we made our reservations in English and they took note. When they saw my bags, they immediately offer a small stool for me to put them down. Everything was thought for and done without any prompting from us. The dishes were served at a good pace so that you don't feel too rushed nor too impatient waiting for the next dish. An overall excellent experience indeed.","976":"Came here with a friend from San Fran who was craving some authentic Cantonese food - and since we were willing to break the piggy bank (quite a few, in fact!), we went all-out and I got a table for two for us in Summer Palace.We had the Chef's Tasting Menu for two (which came with 8 dishes, including dessert), and they were all spectactular! Even the chicken feet, which I usually swear off, smelled and looked to appetising to pass up! Their Homemade Beancurd with Fish Fillet, Fish Gluten and Vegetables sounded super simple, but it was the BEST I've ever had! The beancurd is perfect - soft and smooth inside, and slightly rough on the outside, and the fish fillet was tender, soft and fresh. Wow!Will be back next time (hopefully soon!) and try the rest of the dishes that we didn't see on the menu!","977":"Little glitches here and there but overall a rather pleasant experience. \u00a0Service overall was attentive or at least u can tell the young Jedi was under training so made quiet a few mistakes. \u00a0 Big one not observing the speed the guests were consuming the food. \u00a0 Small ones were spilling the soy sauce while placing the food, his clothes had soy sauce stain, not topping up tea and also asking questions meant for another table. \u00a0 Food wise, suckling pig bettet at Wah Lok. \u00a0Take away dish was the soup in coconut and dessert. The rest was good. \u00a0 overall a wonderful evening and yes complimentary parking!!","978":"Chinese fine dining at its most underwhelming.We ordered the Lily set menu. The Pork was succulent and incredible, but thats where the excitement ended. The Scallop was nothing special. The soup was dull and uncompelling. The Sea Perch lacked the flakey joy you expect and the single solitary prawn sat next to the noodles, carbing you up to ensure you didn't leave hungry.The meal was just fine - and at this price point, it should have been amazing.","979":"I had the Tasting Menu here for a Sunday lunch. It was comprised of 6 courses: (1) Australian abalone, (2) Chicken Soup in a coconut, (3) Wagyu Beef cubes, (4) A small Lobster with asparagus, (5) Grouper with rice in broth, & (6) a dessert of hot sago pudding & crunch bar. Every course was absolutely fabulous. The Chinese Executive Chef Cheung Siu Kong stopped by my table to see how I liked the meal. The dining experience here was outstanding in all respects. They certainly deserve the Michelin star that they have earned.","980":"Great food and service.Starter: Long bean.Deep fried lobster roll, prawn paste & breaded vermicelli - superb, crispy, light & not oily.Deep fried crab - didn't like the cheesy taste. Otherwise, it was good.Saut\u00e9ed Chinese cabbage with shredded pork meat in claypot.Smoked duck (half) with Chinese tea leaves - good taste, crispy skin, perfect sauce (not too sweet or saltish).Poached rice, lobster meat.Dry ah balling (black sesame paste inside, served warm) - Super good and not so hot that it will burn your tongue.","981":"fantastic meal - great ambience, good food - at this classic chinese institution at the ritz-carlton. this was a treat for the mum on her birthday - and we had a great time; I love sitting down in an old-school, luxurious place eating dainty little bits of fatty dim sum.the food here strikes me as being classic but-not-really, very exquisite and rather well made - and very much in line with what I expect from a chinese restaurant inside a hotel: good service, food that's interesting but still familiar, and a peaceful ambience.we did a fair bit of their smallish menu - and it was all pretty good. the food at my favourite paradise pavilion is a little more modern-interesting and might be tastier - but there's just something about sitting in a hotel-housed chinese restaurant that has all the pomp and luxuriance you just don't get in a stand-alone place.I certainly had no qualms about the bill when it arrived, service was polite and our tea cups constantly filled - and the mum had a good time. much worth a visit, especially for a bit of old-school chinese posh.","982":"We stayed at the hotel so wanted to enjoy this restaurant. We assumed it would be significantly better than what we find in Gearhart, Oregon. It was. we got a several course lunch with dim sum. I am not a connoisseur of Cantonese food though we have friends who are. The four dim sum items included a couple that were new to us and a couple that seemed quite ordinary. We had birds nest soup, not a regular item where I go. The fried rice was abundant but not particularly flavorful. The vegetables were ok and we'll prepared. The tea was very nice. Service was good enough. We were the last lunch table seated that day which meant our server was distracted with other duties when we wanted to order and when it was time to serve our food. Still, the four of us enjoyed our lunch.","983":"Sushi Ichi is a great experience for the omakase lover. It's a decent sized counter for around 14 people with a solid crew of sushi chefs. The setup appears very similar to that of both Shinji locations and quite frankly, if you slapped the Shinji name on Ichi, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Ichi is also based in Ginza, like Shinji, but although both Singaporean Michelin Stars are eerily similar, Ichi does have much better service and creativity.In order to dine at Shinji, you need to go to the Marriott Tang Plaza and walk to what looks like a quaint Japanese house. From the main hostess counter, you open the sliding door to your right and are welcomed by a 14 seater bar and 3 energetic chefs. After being seated, you are presented with both the drink and food menus, the latter offers you three selections of a nigiri sushi focused omakase, a mini omakase, or a big boy full cooked dishes and sushi omakase.A friend and I did the sushi nigiri option since our stomachs were already hating us from a full Bacchanalia \"omakase\" from earlier in the day. So keep this in mind about my review, I only did sushi.The service was excellent. The sushi was great as you would expect with a nice textured vinegar rice that almost looks like brown rice. Since we were first timers at Ichi, we received the typical toro, snapper, mackerel, and all of the usual nigiri that chefs give patrons they don't know. They also included a nice ikura, uni and HAIRY CRAB course which I was a big fan of.There are so many top tier sushi places around Orchard Road that you really can't go wrong with and Sushi Ichi is no exception. Frankly, I can't figure out what criteria Michelin gave to award the One Star Sushi spots with their respective stars other than they are all in hotel properties and have Ginza sister restaurants. Nevertheless, it was great and satisfied my sushi craving for the night.Great sushi, service, location, ambiance - Ichi is definitely worth a stop on your Singapore omakase tour.","984":"My go-to place for Sushi indulgence. \u00a0Chef Yuki San makes it a special home-made atmosphere as he is very approachable and passionate of his delicious creations. \u00a0The restaurant as most top restaurants, will periodically update their menu with seasonal items which makes going there something to look forward to and be surprised of what Yuki san have in store for us :) \u00a0 Fav. sushi that's hard to beat at other sushi omakase place are the lean tuna marinated with soy sauce before crafting it to sushi.","985":"That hit all the right spots! Savory, sour, spicy, and slightly sweet. Standard soup that accompanies the bak chor mee. Comes with fish balls, dumplings, and seaweed.Get there early to beat the long lines. One of the most popular bak chor mee in Singapore.","986":"If you are craving for Bak Chor mee, this is a good place to go to. The $6 portion has all the ingredients - minced and sliced pork, beef balls and fried ti poh (fried sole fish). The sauce is a nice blend of soya, chili and vinegar.This stall at Hong Lim is run by the nephew of the Michelin-starred Tai Hwa at Crawford Lane. The queue is definitely shorter at this branch.","987":"My favourite bak chor mee in Singapore! (but... I haven't tried the one at Crawford Lane) I've eaten here quite a few times (when the BCM craving strikes, approx once every 3 weeks) and the quality of the food has always been consistent.Nice, springy noodles (go for the mee pok!) with a generous serving of minced pork, pork balls, fried flatfish, dumplings and just the right amount of fried lard. I especially love the fried flatfish, haven't seen it appear in other BCM places. Very salty on its own but goes well with the noodles+vinegar in the dish!However, they don't seem to be open for as long as the other stalls in Hong Lim food center... (have gone at about 7pm only to see that the store was closed :| ) Make sure that you check the opening hours before heading there!","988":"No no no....this is no way close to the one at Crawford street! Don't be fooled by the same name! Some things in life is worth waiting for.","989":"I prefer this outlet as compared to the branch at Crawford Lane, the queue here is definitely not as bad. The quality of the noodle is pretty good... love the springy texture and it is loaded with ingredients (dried fried flatfish, pork balls, liver, minced pork, mushrooms and handmade dumplings). You must love vinegar as they are rather generous with it in their noodles. \u00a0The soup is rich, meaty and flavorful.","990":"I was at Hong Lim Market and Food Centre on a Sunday afternoon with the initial intention to eat the famous Outram Char Kway Teow. Unfortunately, the Char Kway Teow Stall was closed for the day, as was the case for many other stalls there as well. My friends and I could not decide what to eat and made our choice the typical Singaporean way - by heading for the stall with the longest queue at Tai Wah Pork NoodlesThere was a queue of at least 7 people in front of us when we started queueing and the wait was long (and excruciating since we were all rather starved). The uncle cooking the noodles is quite old and hence, speed isn't the shop's forte. I have to say that the noodles were cooked to perfection - great texture and very springy, and that sorts of justifies the wait. They are also rather generous with their lard servings so for those who love those crispy pillows of lard, this stall would make you pretty happy. However, the sauce combination used was a bit bland for my taste and hence isn't a favourite of mine.","991":"My husband swears by this noodle shop and occasionally tricks me into eating with him. \u00a0They have changed locations a couple times but the dish is best at this outlet. \u00a0 I have to say, it is quite good. \u00a0I love the perfectly cooked liver but leave out the meat balls. \u00a0Their noodles must be homemade. \u00a0I highly recommend it to those who like pork noodle.","992":"Honestly, THESE ARE THE CUTEST PAUS EVER! They are so tiny, and yet so filling because of the way they are handcrafted. The pau's skin is so fluffy and soft despite being so thinly molded at some parts of the pau. And the fillings are so substantial that they literally fill you up! The char siew paus are nicely filled with yummy pork meat that's nicely marinated. But the definite must try is their \"kong bak pau\" - marinated pork belly meat in a smooth bun. These are tiny too, like their chair siew pau counterparts. But unlike the normal kong bak paus, instead of a huge slab of meat, the meat in this bun is nicely shredded yet retaining that moist, flavorful fat. Definitely will head back for these mini pop-in-your-mouth pieces of joy! Less flour, more meat, and yet oh-so-fluffy.","993":"I think I am beginning to like all the traditional old school handmade local food stuff now that it is so hard to find them around. Most of the food we get now are often factory made or from a central kitchen. So it is such a treat to be able to savor food which is made the traditional painstaking way. I first tried the char siew bao a few years ago when my colleague gave me one to try. It was tiny but packed with lip-smacking delicious char siew filling. It was not very fatty and had the right ratio of bun and meat. It was 50 cents then. The price has gone up to 60 cents for the bao (small) and $1.20 for the big bao. Some may feel that it is expensive for something which can be devoured in one mouthful or two bites but I think it is quite alright for something which is handmade and tastes so good. The big bao (pork) is not very big compared to other places but I think the size is just nice for a snack or light meal. The meat inside is juicy and the sauce coats the interior of the bao perfectly so you do not get the feeling of dryness at all. Beware the small bao as you may just keep popping them into your mouth as they are just so good. It is definitely better when served fresh off the steamer.","994":"It's really hard to find places selling kong ba pau (fat belly bun). Apart from this shop and restaurants, the only way to get your hands to these buns is to cook them at home. As for the taste, the pork belly isn't too greasy! That's why i love it !","995":"another fine example of gourmet craftsmanship.my favourite is their mini kong bak bao.delicate bun with delicious filling.one is never enough!two is a teaser.three is a treat.four is forgivable.five is fate.six is sumptuous.seven is surfeiting.eight is enough.as nine is numbing.and ten is time to diet again!","996":"The pao here are tiny and yummy!The skin is very thin, soft and fluffy. the ingredients are packed to the brim.The tao sar is also not too sweet.These little pao are just nice to pop continuously without realizing that you have way over-eaten.","997":"Appearance wise, their mini pau is certainly very cute!! Taste wise, it's only ok leh. I tried their chicken pau and its only normal nice. Their mini char Siew pau is certainly nicer for the eyes than for the tongue.","998":"If size does matters then Teochew Handmade Pau is certainly different. Their paus are tiny. Tiny red bean paus, chicken paus, char siew paus and even kong bak paus. Even their siew mais are tiny. And as the their name states, they are all handmade and started by Mr Yeoh who is Teochew. They also sell fan choy (glutinous char siew rice) and lor mai kai (glutinous chicken rice), which fortunately arent tiny. Prices may feel a little steep, after all for the same 60 cents, you can get a much bigger pau elsewhere. But the novelty and the fact that the paus are actually very yummy makes up for it. Their siew mais are particular yummy because instead of prawns they use fish and instead of crab roe they use carrots. A lot healthier than a standard siew mai but just as tasty.Business is brisk especially the more popular items like the kong bak paus and the lotus paste paus. You can actually call in to pre-order to avoid disappointment. \u00a0I've always been proud to be a teochew because teochews are famous for many local food like fried carrot cake, fried kway teow, kway chap, teochew porridge, etc. Although pau isnt exactly exclusively a teochew specialty, it is still a prime example of good teochew made food here in Singapore.Their opening hours are Tuesday to Saturday - 6:00am to 2:00pm and Sunday - 6:00am to 12:00pm.","999":"If you think that Italian and Japanese do not do \"fusion\" (like I do), you need to come here. Uni pasta is my fav. The wine list is impressive too. ...on the expensive side ...surprise!","1000":"A new rooftop bar\/kitchen by the folks from Kyo. We were invited for the media event, so didn't really get a chance to try their food. Pretty good setting with a nice view of the Suntec area, though.  A provisional four-star rating for now.","1001":"A great place to host an office party! The ambience is great and located at the heart of the CBD district this has mostly office crowd chilling out after a hard at work! The chicken wings are just amazing and so are the chicken croquettes..","1002":"So thanks to being heavily engaged w\/ Yelp, I was basically put in charge of choosing where we eat almost everyday during our 3-week stay. \u00a0It was a random evening and we wanted to check the mall out at Orchard before heading out to dinner. \u00a0I went w\/ 3 of my colleagues... 1 decided to lock herself in the hotel room because she did not want to walk but Jerry and I went and had a blast.Upon walking in, I felt that shorts were not appropriate for this restaurant as I should have been in something dressy\/casual. \u00a0We did not have a reservations so they seated us upstairs - though the downstairs looked so much nicer. \u00a0The menu, our glasses of water, and everything came super fast w\/ the exception of when it was time to pay. \u00a0We were both hungry so:- crispy chicken- banana leaf wrapped puree fish thingy- beef rendang- the blue ginger (chicken dish)Our meal came w\/ pickled vegetables which we both enjoyed. \u00a0The crispy chicken was juicy but under-seasoned, the banana leaf thing was a little weird but it was OK (tastes very fishy), the beef rendang was super tender, and the blue ginger was flavorful; you can taste and sense the ginger. \u00a0None of the dishes came w\/ a base so ordering rice was a must. \u00a0Between the 2 of us, we destroyed our heavy dinner. Jerry became my great eating out partner. \u00a0Service was friendly and the place was clean and modern. \u00a0No complaints.","1003":"Blue Ginger is an average value Peranakan meal - portions are generally small, but with some fantastic dishes. Glad we went - but not in a hurry to return.Great dishes: * Kueh Pue Tee - delicious and refreshing starter* Beef Rendang - succulent well cooked beef.* Nonya Fishhead Curry - the highlight. Wonderfully aromatic curry broth and fantastic red snapper.* Ayam Panggang Blue Ginger - MUCH better than the Buah Keluak, which was underwhelming.","1004":"My go-to for immersing my out of town guests in peranakan fare. My stomach loves this place, but my arteries don't. Heavy, hearty fold that I can only embellish in once every three months at most. Go here.","1005":"Great restaurant for dinner. Nice decorations and atmosphere. We ordered beef rendang and a chicken dish with coconut sauce. Both tasted really good with rice and the pickles served with it. Probably the best food we had during our 5-day stay in Singapore. Drinks were also yummy, try the lime juice ;) very refreshing. Would recommend this to friends as well.","1006":"My Singaporean friend recommended me this place so we came. \u00a0It's my first encounter with Peranakan cuisine and I was told it's a fusion of Chinese and Malay food. \u00a0Very cozy and intimate - good for a small group.Portion is small so we were able to try a few dishes. \u00a0We had a few appetizers but nothing left a lasting memory. \u00a0My friend said I have to try Ayam Buah Keluak at least once - it's unique but can't say it's my favorite. \u00a0We also got the Nonya Fish Head Curry because I said I never had it. \u00a0I am very sensitive to fish so I can't say I like that one either :( \u00a0On the other hand, the Redang was good but I really enjoyed the Udang Masak Assam Gulai. \u00a0I think I had a few plates of rice just on that sauce alone. \u00a0We finished with some chendol, without the durian :P \u00a0I can't say I want this as my last meal on earth but it was a pretty good experience.","1007":"My personal culinary highlight on a trip to Singapore. The Nonya Fishhead Curry was the best fish curry I ever had - incredibly tasty, nicely arranged: a treasure for the eye and the palate.","1008":"My first intro to Peranakan cuisine was at Blue Ginger many moons ago. \u00a0And I always make a point to return to this place everytime I'm in SG. \u00a0Peranakan food is a melange of Chinese and Malay food, derived from the Penang and Malacca region of Malaysia. \u00a0On to the important stuff. \u00a0My favorite item from here is a chicken stew made with the Buah Keluak, which is a relative of the betel nut. \u00a0The nut is apparently poisonous but after \u00a0many hours of preparation and fermentation, \u00a0it yields a very smoky, bitter taste. \u00a0It's cooked with various spices like turmeric and galangal. \u00a0I also love the beef rendang, a curry made with coconut milk, turmeric and lemongrass. \u00a0 I've had my share of beef rendang, far and wide, but I still prefer the rendang from Blue Ginger. \u00a0The meat is tender. \u00a0 \u00a0The spices are subtle but pungent at the same time.For dessert, I can't say enough about the durian chendol. \u00a0It's a dessert made with crushed ice, pandan jelly noodles, coconut milk, durian puree. \u00a0Think distant relative of Filipino halo halo or Vietnamese che. \u00a0It's a lovely cool down from all the spices of the entrees.Blue Ginger is gentrified, I must admit. \u00a0White table cloth. \u00a0Great service. \u00a0 Cozy and intimate. \u00a0It's made for tourists like me. \u00a0And I love it, every time.If you are curious about Peranakan cuisine:en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pe\u0085","1009":"I do overall like this place but I think I would only come here once in awhile. My sister introduced me to the very traditional food here, we got: 1) Kwuh pie tee cups - outside was pretty good 2) beef rendang - it was good but a little bland for me 3) tamarind prawns - the best dish I had, love the flavors in this 4) white wine - do not order 5) otta otta - interesting and worth an order Portions are quite small but there is unlimited rice and pickled veggies.","1010":"I excellent paranakan food, each time I am in Singapore I visit this restaurant and I always enjoy good food and service here.","1011":"This is a review of a delayed birthday dinner with a friend at The Blue Ginger. \u00a0This is an update to a previous review. \u00a0Since, with \u00a0the exception of kueh pie tee, I had completely different dishes this time, I thought it was worthwhile to write a new review.Plus, the second \u00a0time around, my overall experience was more consistently \u00a0positive.Obviously, the ambiance has not changed. \u00a0So, I will mostly pull from my previous review. \u00a0I also have now included interior photos .The room is stylish. \u00a0There are beautiful accents and warm colours providing the room with a warm and comfortable home-like feel. \u00a0It is a pretty small restaurant and the seating can be a touch cramped. \u00a0I am relatively large and this doesn't help the situation.tinyurl.com\/b3r7c7qtinyurl.com\/bh2tzmqAn additional positive (at least for me), is that, on both visits, they were playing Pink Martini. \u00a0This is one of my favorite musical groups and not one that I would expect to find playing in a Singaporean restaurant.The service was more consistent than my first visit. \u00a0The staff was attentive and very present. \u00a0They checked often to insure things were going well. \u00a0I also thought the \u00a0meal was better paced. \u00a0They were all very friendly, polite, and professional.The food ranged from good to extremely good. \u00a0The food was also nicely presented.Mixed pickles and sambal belachan are provided on each table. \u00a0However, these are not complimentary. \u00a0There is a small charge. \u00a0The rice is also included in these charges. \u00a0Throughout the meal, the rice is served as needed.tinyurl.com\/askhol5tinyurl.com\/c7j6nqxKueh Pie Tee (Shredded bamboo shoots and turnips garnished with shrimp in pie tee cups) - This was very good. \u00a0The cups were perfectly fried and the fillings were fresh.tinyurl.com\/bg5v54lNonya Rolls - They were quite delicious. \u00a0They were super crunchy. \u00a0The yam added a very nice sweetness that typical spring rolls do not have.tinyurl.com\/afmeak2Ayam Panggang \"Blue Ginger\" (De-boned chicken thigh and drumstick flavoured with coconut milk rich in exotic spices and grilled) - I am lucky this was one of two great chicken dishes I've had recently. \u00a0The chicken was so moist and tender. \u00a0The flavours went so well together. \u00a0The coconut, dash of heat, and other spices just took this chicken dish over the top.tinyurl.com\/cgbkzd3Beef Rendang (Tender beef cubes prepared in rich coconut milk spiced with ginger, lemon-grass, lime leaves and a dash of curry powder) - This is the best rendang I've eaten yet. \u00a0Now, I've not had that many. \u00a0But this was a very tasty dish. \u00a0There was just loads of flavour. \u00a0There was a richness and almost a smokiness to the flavours.tinyurl.com\/a49u8jdNonya Fish Head Curry (Red snapper with ladies fingers and eggplant cooked in a traditional home-style curry) - The only specific request my friend made was she wanted the fish head curry. \u00a0This was my inaugural fish head curry. \u00a0I am not sure what I was waiting for. \u00a0I have no idea how this stacks up against other fish head curries. \u00a0I do know it was extremely good. \u00a0The seasonings in the broth were amazing. \u00a0The fish was tender and flaky. \u00a0Some way, the spices did not overpower the delicate taste of the fish. \u00a0The vegetables were crisp. \u00a0The okra did not have even a hint of the slipperiness that can so easily develop with okra. \u00a0This was just an all around great dish. \u00a0Visually, it was also quite appetizing.tinyurl.com\/a87tetsReceipt ($102.75):tinyurl.com\/c8r7pexOverall, this was a very enjoyable dining experience. \u00a0The food was consistently well-prepared with very substantial and well-balanced flavours. \u00a0The attentive and friendly service combined with the warm and inviting room to compliment the food perfecty. \u00a0In my last review, I was rounding up a bit. \u00a0For this visit to The Blue Ginger, I am providing a very solid four star review.","1012":"Peranakan cuisine! Great location so I've been a few times and was happy with the food each time. With this menu I love trying new things i haven't each time though slightly pricey.","1013":"For me, this is the best Peranakan restaurant in Singapore.This is one of the restaurant I go to for comfort food. It tastes like home cooking which I love. The quality is consistent and all the dishes I tried there are very tasty.Definitely a place to bring guests visiting Singapore.","1014":"A friend was visiting so I wanted to take her to a Peranakan restaurant. \u00a0My usual favorite Candlenut was fully booked (it was Friday night alas!) so I called Blue Ginger on the recommendation of a Singaporean friend and got us a table.The restaurant is set in a shop house in Tanjong Pagar, a good place to take visitors. \u00a0Renovation is simple, and so are the dishes, they have a feeling of home-cooked fare to them - unpretentious, not fancy but delicious, definitely a day-to-day staple. \u00a0We ordered the kueh pie tee, the bakwan kepeting (soup made of pork and crab meatball with bamboo shoots), beef rendang, kangkong and a seabass cooked in a spicy tamarind gravy. \u00a0I would say everything turns out to be pretty good, just like what fine Peranakan cooking should be and the prices are reasonable and definitely cheaper than Candlenut. \u00a0The only complaint I have is the pork and crab meatball with bamboo shoots had somewhat of a pungent smell to it. The food is definitely above average but I would say that it lacks the surprises I get from Candlenut where I feel the presentation of the food and the combination of ingredients and flavors are all perfect. \u00a0It is definitely not bad but is also not my go-to place. \u00a0Nevertheless, it's a good option considering the lower prices in general.","1015":"Looking for a 'landing pad' that perfectly encompasses the worldly influences of Singaporean food culture, decades of gritty history, and charming old-world architecture and interior design? Well, this is my definite bet for the perfect place to go (and you can tell, because you will see visitors gathering in large round tables from China and the 'west' grinning from ear to ear, clamouring about the toothsome splendour that is The Blue Ginger). The Beef Rendang is something that is on par with your friendly neighbourhood makcik's best efforts... chunks of beef in a dark maroon gravy (careful! it's so good that you might find yourself licking the plate clean) that's been sitting in a stew enriched with shallots, chilli peppers, lemon grass, turmeric, coconut, and galangal for more than four hours... Servings are larger than at the Grandma's Restaurants on Orchard, where they are puny and never enough, and they come up to about the same price-tag (and taste a LOT better).Other must-orders are the Otak-otak (shiok as hell!), with the lemongrass so freshly potent that your nostrils will be flaring in pleasure, and the Deep-fried Brinjal in Sambal... I'm getting hungry for Blue Ginger all over again!","1016":"i really liked this! perhaps because it was my first foray into peranakan cuisine, or perhaps because of the great company, but i found the food very interesting and different.of particular interest was the buah keluak dish, which has these nuts that are supposedly poisonous unless you cook it the right way. it tasted like a really nutty olive tapenade, and was quite delightful.i also really loved the ngo heong. my first time having this and they were little flavor bombs of awesome wrapped in a lightly crispy wrapper.everything else tasted great, but these 2 in particular stood out. i'm giving it the much coveted xander 5 stars, although i'm not sure how this compares to other peranakan restaurants, since this is my first try.","1017":"Good quality Nonya restaurant. I was there a few years ago and was so impressed that I went back recently. \u00a0There were many local diners on the night so it is a sign that the food is good. Lucky we got there early as I could see them turning away people. It was a bit more expensive that the food centres, but the food was tasty, authentic, the ambient was great, and the service was great.","1018":"I understand that Blue Ginger may be a bit of an institution for Peranakan cuisine and I can see why. A particularly easy place for Westerners to dine as the menu is varied without being too extensive, and the descriptions are well written with certain items identified as special recommendations. The price level is higher than what you would expect at a 'local joint' but less than those of many of the other 'westernised' eateries' we visit. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, but stand outs were the whole sambal fish, the chicken rolls and the prawns. The whole fish is a little intimidating when it first arrives at the table but just get stuck in! The sweet sambal over the crispy fried skin... dericious! I also am a sucker for sago pudding with gula melaka... not bad here, but the sago had congealed a bit more than necessary and I prefer it without the ice shavings. Service is polite and attentive. Decor is a bit dated (I thought) but in keeping with a traditionalist theme and \u00a0far from off-putting. Their wine and beer list could probably be widened a bit more, especially wine by the glass. We spent $60 per person for starters, mains and two drinks each. I think this is a great place to bring visitors to give them a taste of peranakan cuisine. Next I want to try Peranaman and then off to Melaka for the graduation of peranakan cuisine!","1019":"Good flavours on non-veg dishes. Nice pickles to snack on. Veg mains - limited options and flavourless. Applicable for lunch and dinner not a breakfast or brunch place. Gets quite busy during lunch \/ dinner, need to book in advance.If anything try the oyster sauce main next time.","1020":"Wonderfully decorated dining room and great air conditioning! Food is unique fusion -- not all the flavors worked for us -- very strong fishy tastes on some items made them almost inedible. Service was unhurried but efficient -- but we found ourselves looking for the waiter because the pauses were long. Worth a visit if you are looking to try something different, but, thinking back, there are many other worthy restaurants in the same neighborhood, so I'd skip it next time -- not on the \"must visit\" list at all.","1021":"the food is quite authentic peranakan and worth a try especially with big groups but the seating area is quite tight and squeezy. I must say that the kueh pie tee is one of the best I have ever had. The portions are just nice that it fits into the mouth comfortably in one go and melts neatly into your mouth in one superb food orgasm.Everything else is spicy spicy spicy and the dessert sweet sweet sweet. Didn't help that our group had a diabetic and needed something not sweet. Not much options for him there. Not even fruits. So don't bring any diabetic friends and relatives there.","1022":"Not honest. Overcharged by 25% expecting us not to notice because we were a large party. They clearly added on a bunch of drinks that we did not order and did so as the meal progressed. Also, people seemed to get sick the next day. The fish dishes were larger than expected the food was otherwise ok.","1023":"Even though I was only passing through Singapore for a few days, I will be damned if I was not going to get any Peranakan food. \u00a0This place is very Ang Moh friendly, if you are afraid to attack the hawker centres. \u00a0There were three of us and we tried to eat everything that we could - egg rolls, beef rendang, fried tofu, prawn - it was all delicious. \u00a0It was a bit pricy, but that is not surprising given the neighborhood.","1024":"Worth a try for people who enjoys good food especially tasty peranakan cuisine. If spicy food is your thing, you will enjoy the food here. Service was good.","1025":"just a normal Chinese restaurantwe've been there with a large group of 20+ guests and had chosen several different dishes (appetizer & main dishes) to share amongst us. the food was ok, but nothing really special. some dishes, like the mackarel, were nobody's flavor, maybe simply because not really differentiating to a normal fast food Chinese restaurant.conclusion of the group, some liked it (4*), some meant it was normal (3*) and some were disappointed (2*)PS: only some of the servant were able to speak English, but at least the others understood the words Beer and Rice... ;-)","1026":"I really enjoyed this place. I cannot comment on how true it is to Peranakan cuisine but for my palate I enjoyed the two vegetarian options I tried. Probably my favorite dining experience during my Singapore visit--everything I tried tasted incredible, and the service was excellent, which was in retrospect even more of a plus given how poor it seemed to be everywhere else. I'd recommend this and would gladly return.","1027":"We just tried a few dishes here after wandering around chinatown. \u00a0 We were pleased with the quality of the food and had good service.","1028":"There are these times that one has an inkling that a place is good - just judging by what it looks like. I had noticed this restaurant a few times from the Kamayan across the street and went to eat there today with a friend, and yes: this place is really good. The cuisine is described as peranankan (the mixure of chinese and malay that is typical for the singapore chinese), but I suspect this is a means to present a cuisine that is really a fusion of the different cultures of Southeast Asia. No matter: the result is excellent. I had chicken in an Indonesian sauce based on nuts I did not know but that were delicious - chocolate like (ayam buah keluak), and my companion had pork knuckles braised to perfection in another herb mix (babi hong). Both tasted delicious and I certainly go back for more. Even the rice on itself was perfumed in a way I didn't recognize. All in all, we had an excellent meal - the best I had in this area of Singapore. And the prices were - by European standards - certainly affordable. It is however safe to make reservations: we were lucky to be early.","1029":"I brought a friend to Clifford Pier for their Sunday brunch buffet. It was SGD52 per person and offered a wide variety of local foods. It was a great way for my friend to taste a mix of all the local foods in a beautiful historical setting. There was Chicken Rice, Satay, Kway Teow, dim sum, congee, sushi, rojak, laksa, chilli crab and other delicacies. Each dish is clearly labeled (especially with ingredients so if you have any food allergies you can avoid them). They also served local desserts and ice cream. Of course you could find better quality food at specific hawker locations or restaurants, but if you dont have time to hit various locations, this was a central location allowing my friend to have small samples and go in for repeats. The buffet also doesnt have a time limit, so we were there from 11:30am till 2:30pm (when they close). I am not sure how the a la carte menu is priced, but I would go for their buffet selection based on price and quality. Worth the visit and surely a place I will bring future guests who are on a short stop and never had any of the local flavors!","1030":"5* Hotel but not the food. (The Peranakan Special Edition)I have wanted to dine at Clifford Pier for ages. It's a gorgeous restaurant in a gorgeous hotel, with an even more gorgeous view, so when The Clifford Pier promoted that they were having a Peranakan Cuisine showcase by guest Chef Philip Chia, I knew we had to give it a try. The menu isn't extensive, just the highlights of Peranakan Food like Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Pongteh and Nonya Chap Chye but with all the essentials there, it was enough for us to give it a shot. Ayam Buah Keluak ($28) The benchmark of any Peranakan Reataurant has to be the Ayam Buah Keluak. You can usually determine how good or bad your dinner is going to be from the way this dish was prepared and it was no different here. The sauce was very fragrant and very good. Lighter and slightly more watery than those I'm used to, it still had distinctive taste from the Rempah (spice blend) with a hint of the Buah Keluak. The Buah Keluak itself was something special. We're used to having it either as it is, or with the \"meat\" dug out , mixed with minced pork and stuffed back in but this one was special. They dug it out, mixed with with the rempah before stuffing it back in the shell. This made the Buah Keluak meat very flavorful and less pungent, which is good for beginners. Only thing is the way they cracked the shell. We usually open it down the side but because the opened it at the top and made it a pretty small opening (smaller than the teaspoon give), it made it very difficult to dig out the filling with a knife. The let down though was the chicken. They gave three chunky pieces of thigh yet every piece was cooked till it was dry and tough. Very very disappointing. Babi Pongteh ($28)Another easily recognizable Peranakan dish, the Babi Pongteh is a wonderful stewed pork dish with a bean paste. The flavours again was very nice. The sauce was fragrant and wonderfully thickened by the fat from the pork belly. It is a bit sweeter that the Pongtehs that I'm used too but it wasn't by any means overpowering. The problem again was the cook of the meat. While the fat was wonderfully melt in your mouth and the meat around the fat was tender and juice, it got extremely dry and tough as you reached the bottom. Another case of overcooked protein. Nonya Chap Chye ($18)Probably Peranakans most well-know vegetable dish, a Nonya chap Chye is more than just putting vegetable together and boiling it in a pot. There's a lot of care that goes into it with each vegetables different cook time. The key to any Chap Chye is ensuring the sweetness of the cabbage shine yet allowing strong flavors of the fermented soya bean and dried Beancurd skin to come come through. Too much or little of either and it'll lose the balance of the dish. The version served here is easier on the palette for those who do not like the taste of beancurd skin or fermented bean paste. It's naturally sweet \u00a0 With that hint of saltiness from the bean paste, however, I hate to eat it again and again but.......... It was overcooked!The cabbage was mushy, the carrots were so soft I could mash it with my tongue and even the black fungus, that normally offers a nice crunch to the otherwise soft texture, was cooked till I could break it apart without biting. Lemon Barely ($5)This had to be the most natural tasting lemon barleys I've ever had. No artificial, cordial lemon barely here. It was straight up boiled barley drink (yes with the cooked barley in the glass), rock melon and lemon juice. A good way to counter the richness and spiciness of the Peranakan dishes. On a whole, the dining experience was decent but certainly not 5 star quality. The ongoing trend here was that, while the flavors were good, the main protein and veg were all over cooked. Chicken, pork, vege, all cooked way over than it should be. I understand the need to leave them in the flavor the dish but there's a ceiling and unfortunately, all the dishes here went way way way over it. Oh and unfortunately, service wasn't up to standard too. 1) servers were not strategically placed. It took a while to get someone's attention as all the wait staff were near the entrance while we were near the rear. 2) they were preparing for an event outside. I know there's a need to have background music but a. Did they really need to blast the music and fill hall with bass-y chill out longer music? Considering that the guest hadn't even arrive? b. To rectify the issue, they ended up turning up the ambient music in the restaurant! Not till it was deafening because we could still talk but to a point that it was above the comfort range. So overall: Venue: 5*Ambience: 3* (thanks to he music) Service: 3* Food: 3* I would love to give this experience a 4 but I'll wait till my next visit before determining.","1031":"We went here on our transit stop in Singapore and enjoyed a lovely buffet full of delicious yumminess, before our flight to Frankfurt. The hotel has a giant dining area, as well as a lounging area right beside it. Both are equally large with very high ceilings and an exquisite atmosphere. From what I have heard, the full-on buffet is not a regular happening, but on this day, there was a celebration in town (we went at the end of May), which was the partial reason for the buffet. From antipasti, to seafood, to salads, skewers, traditional rice- and noodle dishes, glazed pork belly and more; they had EVERYTHING on the menu. We were very happy with our choices.The staff was equally helpful with allergy questions and very attentive, which is also a great bonus. Can only recommend.","1032":"There are two restaurants within Fullerton Bay Hotel, so make sure you go to the correct one. The other one is called Clifford Restaurant so look out!This place is a beautiful dining hall overlooking the MBS side, with nice chandeliers, big big vases of white orchids, and soft background music playing by a live band (for dinner). It is a very, very pleasant experience to dine here. Service here is impeccable, and waitstaff are attentive and prompt.Let's come to the important bit. The food.Cuisine here is Singaporean hawker food, served with an upmarket touch. The prices here are a steep mark-up from the usual hawker fare, so be prepared to shell out some heavy dough. I came here with a companion and we started with two popiah rolls (thin crepes stuffed with turnip, prawns, egg) ($12). I had the laksa with lobster ($36), which I enjoyed, apart from it not having cockles... My grouse was that my laksa was not Instagram-worthy, with bits of chopped lobster scattered in the laksa. Come on guys, for 36 bucks++ the laksa better look good.My companion had fried snapper with brinjal\/eggplant. He rated it 6\/10. You have to order rice separately, which is $5 extra, but you have a choice between white and brown rice, which is freeflow. Pretty sweet. I like the brown rice option. Plus point for having healthier choices!We ended the meal with a key lime pie for him, and an ice kacang for me.The key lime pie was good, and had a good digestive crust. They were very accommodating when I mentioned I didn't want peanuts and red beans inside my ice kacang. The ice kacang differs from the hawker one - the ice is very finely blended\/ground, so that it is soft and is melt-in-the-mouth, unlike the crunchy feel from the hawker ice kacang. Our bill for two came up to 200 because we had two beers and a glass of champagne (they sell Perrier Jouet by the glass ehre ($30)). If you don't drink, I think this meal is still affordable - comparable to a normal restaurant meal.Would I come back? Maybe. Definitely not getting alcohol next time!","1033":"Ambience - classy and cosyFood - can be betterService - goodThe restaurant is overlooking Marina Bay Sands and is situated right on the spot of the old Clifford Pier where people board the boats to go to nearby islands. Although the place has been given a new wardrobe, the stuctures still remain and feels very nostalgic!","1034":"You come here for the big hotel lobby ambience and the view of the Marina Bay Sands and all that. Food - not so much.We came for Sunday brunch, which featured mostly Sing\/Malay stuff. They also have dim sum of sorts including some steamed stuff that is wheeled around in carts. It was all tasty enough, but really nothing special at all. And at S$48 per adult, it's expensive fare for what it is.","1035":"This is an upscale \"coffee Shop\" in Fullerton Bay Hotel. Food is an eclectic mixof local and western. Dishes are generously portioned but average. Flavors are somewhat authentic but skewed to western tastes. We had the key lime pie and rum baba for dessert. Avoid like the plague. It was terrible. It is somewhat better than your average coffee shop in ambiance and service. But with 3 star prices, it's a place to chill out for brunch or lunch in the weekend but ultimately not a value.","1036":"Only the fruit is tasty, all the food are terrible. Save your $ for something better.","1037":"Had a colleague in town, and this was a nice respite after walking all the way along the Singapore River from Clarke quay MRT station. Definitely a nice place to bring visitors from out of town, as the place looks impressive, and you can show them google photos of that the Pier \/ area used to look like. Service is ok. Quality of food not too bad, but definitely on the pricey side. 12 sticks of satay for more than $20, and the meat on the skewers were strangely flat. The kong bak paus were pretty nice.","1038":"Best Nasi Lemak this side of the causeway. You know those restaurants that do just one dish, but do it phenomenally well? This is one of those places. Runny egg, tender chicken, amazing rich flavourful rice. Each ingredient comes together perfectly on a plate of affordable joy.","1039":"This is my go to place for delicious nasi lemak. The rice is really infused with coconut flavor and is not overly strong. The flavor also does not taste synthetic like some other places. I will suggest to just get the nasi lemak and maybe a lemongrass drink. That is light and refreshing. The nasi lemak comes with sambal (not too sweet or spicy), fried egg with runny yolk (not all the time), cucumber, crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts and two pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken is yummy, the best thing next to the rice. The side dishes are ok, not that special or fantastic to warrant the prices. Same for the desserts. It gets crowded fast, so you will only be seated if everyone is your group is there.","1040":"The Coconut Club6 Ann Siang HillSingaporeNasi Lemak in air conditioned shop house.Very good nasi lemak even though I'm not a nasi lemak fan.Ikan bilis are crispy yet not hard. For chicken it is only chicken thigh, no other choice. Comes with sambal.For fish today it is selar fish. It has just the right texture. Not overcooked like it so often is at Hawker stalls. Black sauce with onions and chilli is so good.Kueh salat has a strong taste of I can't quite make out what (coconut?). Not as good as Chalk Farm's.Chendol has a lot of gula melaka. Okay, not great.Ice lemongrass drink. Not nice.","1041":"Much-hyped new nasi lemak joint in town. Pretty good, but overall it just felt like something was missing... maybe it lacked a bit of kick. Chicken was great, but the rice could've been a bit more flavourful. Chilli was probably the weak spot here. The chendol came highly recommended as well, but just tasted too sweet as a whole. The homemade jelly was a nice touch though! Service was pretty good... we were lucky to arrive at 1140 and be seated immediately, but come any later and be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait. I think I'll be back, but hope they keep tinkering with the formula!","1042":"Despite the price tag and what I thought would be too hipster to be good, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at The Coconut Club! Of course, I still thought it was utterly overpriced, but for a nice restaurant in Club Street with a\/c and yummy food? Aiight, I'll pay for it.I went on a Friday night and got a seat right away which is a nice change for Club Street that's always bustling and with people spilling onto the street. Service was fairly prompt, and it would have been nice to have the specials on the board instead of me having to ask if the menu was all there is to it and then the server then filling in the gaps on their specials of the day.I ordered the nasi lemak (of course) and the sayur lemak (which is apparently the less creamy version of sayur lodeh - it certainly tasted that way too) which was one of the specials. The nasi lemak came out looking delicious! The rice was coconut-y and fragrant, the egg was a nice oozy crisp, the ikan bilis was fried without being too hard, the chilli was a little too much on the spicy side (and just not as delicious as the one at Adam Road) and the chicken was glorious. The chicken was a full thigh and drumstick, was marinated in this delicious marinade (lots of local herbs - lemongrass and the like) and fried to juicy perfection. Yum. The sayur lemak had a really good broth - possibly ikan bilis? I made the unfortunate mistake of mixing all the chilli into it and ended up sniffling my way through my meal although it was really quite delicious. Although they also serve alcohol, my dining companion and I both got the lemongrass tea which was serviceable.This was all-in-all a very satisfying meal, and although I might still return to Adam Road for my nasi lemak fix (at a much lower price point too), I wouldn't say no to anyone asking me to get nasi lemak if I were ever in the Club Street area.","1043":"Too expensive. Chilli was sub par. Chicken was too dry. The Ikan bilis was ok. The only good thing was otak otak.However unlike most other restaurants in Singapore, customer service was great.","1044":"Amazing! \u00a0I find myself looking forward to this every time I head back to Singapore.It is as close to home made Nasi Lemak as you can find outside.The only thing is they are only open for lunch...","1045":"Fantastic dinner spot! Great service. I would call ahead to make sure you have a nice table. Also have a drink on the roof top great place to enjoy the light show. Oleksandra is fantastic ask for her!","1046":"I was staying in the Fullerton Hotel so I decided to have dinner in their 8th floor restaurant. To start with I had the Burrata Di Andria. It came with lovely heirloom tomatoes & a minuscule drop of pesto. The cheese itself was okay, but too large and served too cold. I also had the crusted red snapper with small pur\u00e9ed cauliflower dots as my main course. The fish was very good.Sadly, the service here is a distraction. While they attempt a snobbish appeal, they merely come off as sycophantic and lacking in sincerity.Location - 5 STARSAmbiance\/Decor - 5 STARSFood - 4 STARSService - 3 STARSValue - 4 STARS","1047":"It's been a few years since my previous review and I believe they have figured out their footing since being awarded the Michelin Star. The food has improved tremendously, so much so that I have been bringing colleagues and friends here where many try Indian food for the first time.Both the buffet and their a la carte menu are wonderful. I highly recommend their samosas, Delhi Chaat, Tandoori Prawns and any of their naan. Their chicken tikka masala and butter chicken is quite normal.Their kulfi and gulab jamans are excellent.It is my no means the best or most innovative Indian cuisine out there but it hits the spot for a good meal. Definitely check it out if you are wanting a great Indian meal.","1048":"was concerned a 1 Star Michelin Indian restaurant would be too remote and disconnected from Indian food for my preference. Somehow Song Of India was both authentic and innovative. Tastes and flavors were familiar but heightened delicate and enjoyable. Excellent staff and setting. A true Michelin experience","1049":"Very interesting place to say the least. Very well set up Indian restaurant and this pleasantly surprised me. Very few Indian restaurants I have seen spend time in food presentations and this was most unique point for this restaurant. We were an office group of 9 and opted for the set course - non vegetarian - Journey through India. Good appetizers in salmon and tandoori and a very nice dessert choice. Definitely worth trying if you fancy some \"fancy\" Indian restaurant!","1050":"Solid, Indian fine dining in Singapore. \u00a0The Michelin star is well deserved. \u00a0I opted for a delicious tandoori appetizer which consisted of chicken, minced lamb kebab, paneer and aloo. \u00a0All were delicious but not quite as spicy as the tandoori meal that I recently had in Delhi. \u00a0As a general theme, ask for spicy if you are accustomed to it.I followed the appetizer with butter chicken and naan. \u00a0The butter chicken \u00a0was excellent and the naan was thin and crispy in a way that I typically find only in India.I passed on dessert to ensure that I could make the 1.5 mile walk back to my hotel.The service was gracious and professional, as one would expect from an establishment with a Michelin star. \u00a0The service was also kind and light-hearted. \u00a0The staff took extra care of this lone diner to ensure my time with them was as pleasant as possible.I really like \"The Song of India\" and I hope to return for another meal in the very near future!","1051":"I had booked this restaurant with great expectations as well as with high hopes that this will be our second Michelin Indian dining experience (The first being Taj Campton Place in San Francisco)! I had opted for the veg tasting menu while my husband chose the non-veg tasting menu. The interior of the restaurant is very weirdly oriented and has few private rooms too. I liked the open kitchen concept. There was just one complimentary starter of bread roll which was very bland & definitely not the best taste to keep me wanting for more. The service was very mediocre & definitely not upscale of that a Michelin dining experience. Food was hit or miss, nothing to make me feel wow. They never changed the cutleries nor cleaned the table of the crumbs. I couldn't find any difference of food-taste or style or presentation or service that could justify its Michelin rating. The worst part was to find a dead ant on the rim of the glass where some gravy was served! Although the manager came & apologized, nothing was offered as complimentary to compensate for that worse experience. I have dined in several Michelin restaurants in different parts of the world to state that this could have been a normal Indian restaurant. What I liked was the starter.. which was a mix platter of samosa, veg patties & gol gappas. In the main course, okra fry & daal was good! My husband loved his chicken tikka gravy. In the dessert option, I really enjoyed the beet root halwa. In short, the food can be hit or miss... don't go here with Michelin dining mindset but just an ordinary Indian restaurant. I don't think I would like to return again, there are far better restaurants in this country to enjoy.","1052":"We heard about this Michelin rated restaurant and decided to try it out for the lunch buffet. The setting is very nice and the waitstaff are attentive and friendly. However, the food really fell flat for me. For such a highly rated place I was expecting way more. There was a good spread of curries, vegetable dishes, biryani and rice, but they all lacked any real flavor. For some reason all the dishes were bland and not even a little spicy. I was confused because the made to order appetizers were fantastic! The meat was tender and \u00a0flavorful. This was not the case for the main buffet, unfortunately. I really wanted to like this place, but for the price and prestige it's not worth it.","1053":"We found our way over to The Song of India one Thursday night on our quest to check out more Michelin Starred restaurants in Singapore.Overall, the experience at The Song of India was mixed. \u00a0There were three things that made me super happy and 2 things that could have been better...Let's start with the happy things:1) The restaurant is a Poke stop...now I know this may be cool for only a short time, but for right now, this is something that makes me very happy! \u00a0I didn't catch anything new during dinner, but I did catch quite a few pokemons...an awesome diner had a lure on the restaurant the whole time so it was pretty fantastic2) The restaurant is participating in the Citi wine and dine promotion, so we got a free bottle of wine (we picked the red, but there was a choice of red or white)...the only condition is that you have to order at least $100 worth of food, which is pretty easy for 2 people at The Song of India3) The ambiance is really cool...it's a stand alone house and there are a lot of dramatic decorative touches inside as wellThe things that could have been better:1) It feels like there are too many tables in the restaurant for a higher end place and we felt a bit too close to the table next to us...perhaps the crowding is because the restaurant also has a buffet?2) The food was rather hit or miss...we like half the dishes we ordered and the other half were just ok...this was disappointing given the high acclaimThe food:We liked the Kebab Tasting Platter as a starter as it gave us a chance to try several different kebabs. \u00a0The Cottage Cheese Bhuna Makhni was also very tasty. \u00a0Unfortunately, the Kashmiri Roganjosh (traditional lamb curry) and Goan Fish Curry were both quite forgettable.PARTING THOUGHT: For the same price point, Punjab Grill seems to be a better alternative, although with a far less compelling ambiance...","1054":"Worst Indian upscale restaurant I have ever been too. Service is sub par. Food is very bland. Can't believe they got Michelin star","1055":"I have to say the one restaurant that I wanted to return to on my second trip to Singapore was The Song of India. The food is excellent. It did not disappoint on my second visit. My coworker and I ordered one starter and split one vegetarian and one lamb dish. The one thing to watch out for is they don't ask you the level of spice that you want. I love spicy and it was very reasonable for me. My coworker thought the cauliflower dish was too spicy. I loved it. Definitely worth a visit especially if you are on an expense account.","1056":"I actually went here on my birthday with a bunch of friends and their families so I had a good time there. First impressions were that this was a very posh restaurant. I was right. The whole place itself looked very grand and the furniture was great. The lighting was perfect and it just makes you feel rich just by being there. It's set in an old Singaporean Bungalow-ish home so thats pretty unique.Now the food. Was honestly one of the best North Indian food I have ever tasted and that's coming from a South Indian. The food was cooked perfectly and I didn't feel like there was much room for improvement. There were Indian desserts, side dishes, main courses and just being there and eating their food which is so rich in flavor just made you feel like a king. The customer service was great and all the waiters were smartly dressed so I have no comment on that. Only problem is there might be a bit of a jam in the road outside this area but that isn't because this restaurants is well known. It's because it's located in the city area or at least, close to the city area. \u00a0So if you are looking for an Indian Restaurant to bring your partner out on a date, look no further! This restaurant is perfect for the two of you. Although quite pricey, the food is definitely worth it.","1057":"Don't see the quality of Michelin star restaurant. Food was out of taste. Service was very poor. Overall don't recommend this to anyone.","1058":"I kept quiet because my friend really enjoyed it but I found the Sunday brunch to be overpriced, bland and boring. I typically eat only vegetarian Indian but tried the chicken and regretted it. Most dishes were watery and thin, like the daal, so bowls would have been better than plates. The watermelon was rotten. The service was slow. The ladies room was absolutely filthy and smelled like a barn. The soap dispenser was broken and had been filled with water. Bottled water and tea weren't included in the $39.90 buffet so it was $59 per person and a true waste of money. I do not understand how they received a star from Michelin Guide Singapore.","1059":"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND DISGUSTING FOOD! I ended up with food poisoning for the next one week after having dinner here. First of all I had been to this restaurant 7 years ago and was so annoyed by their service and quality of food that I never went back. But recently they have been advertising and I thought maybe they have improved so I decided to try this restaurant again. As soon as I entered they asked: Do you have a reservation? But what I don't understand is why do they have to ask this question when the restaurant is completely empty. The food was pricey but I don't mind paying that price if the quality of the food is great. But it was horrible and this is the first time my family and I left the food as we couldn't finish it. While leaving we thought of providing a feedback about the quality of the food and all the manager replied: Please come back again and we will let our chef know. Hahah I think he fails to understand that I will never even of think of going back again.","1060":"When you dine at Song of India you are paying for the atmosphere. This restaurant is set in a lovely historic Black & White Singapore home. The appetizer(s) I had (Indian sampler) was very well thought out offering a good mix of items. The main course was nothing special and honestly I feel I could have received the same item at a hawker center for much less . The waitstaff was very attentive.","1061":"I have eaten much better quality food at places which don't call themselves Michelin star restaurants. \u00a0Disappointing and slow service is to be expected.","1062":"I love that this restaurant is in a Black & White house along Scotts Road.The interior is pretty nice but a little too dark when you go for lunch. It felt like I was having dinner and got blinded by the sun when I got out. (Yes, it did not rain that afternoon!)So I decided to have lunch there that day after passing in front so many times. During lunch, they have a buffet so I decided to try it to sample a few of their dishes.The food was just okay. The naam was hard, the vegetables dry, and the meats in the curries not very tender. Maybe the A La Carte is better, but the buffet is not worth trying.","1063":"For the price, it was just ok. Chicken tikka starter too thick with coating and dry. Tikka masala main flavour was good but not a wow.","1064":"Great Lunch Buffett, I have tried this once and now eat the lunch buffett nearly every week. \u00a0They have a good selection of dishes and dessert. \u00a0The price is reasonable at 28++.","1065":"How exciting, Singapore's first Michellen Star Indian restaurant. I went here for Sunday lunch right when they opened. The service was very good, the decor is very upscale and nice. The food was not impressive. The chicken was even a little tough in butter chicken curry. The selection was not very big. As a comparison i found the lunch buffet at Yantra significantly more impressive in the quality, taste and selection. I dont plan on coming back and wonder what Michellen saw in this place.","1066":"The naan bread is one of the best I have had - crispy, chewy and slightly sour. Service was exceptional as well - they made an excellent clear soup off menu for us without cream.","1067":"A pretty restaurant decked out in the the premises of a bungalow, how quaint! The setting is elegant, and much pride has obviously gone into the decor and comfortable furnishing. It's a bit of a pity that more people don't patronise the restaurant. Indeed, when I was there for lunch one weekday, there were only three tables filled, including ours. There was a buffet going on at an attractive rate, and we partook in the offer - a rather wide spread of curries, naans, meats, vegetables, biryani and even dessert. Food was well executed even for a buffet standard, and there were vegetarian friendly options. The naans are a little on the chewier side than what I'm used to though. My only other gripe was that the servers were a little too keen to clear off the buffet items on the dot. A quick flip through the menu evidenced that the a la carte dishes were on the pricy side though. I suppose with the addition of wine, your credit card might smoke a little at the end of your meal. Parking is easy, given that there are ample lots around the bungalow (and not many customers around).","1068":"I don't particularly crave Indian food, but I do crave Song of India food. \u00a0Located in an elegant black and white next to Indocafe \/ the White House and just a few doors down from the Sheraton on Scotts by the Newton MRT, this restaurant \u00a0has an elegant, romantic feel and suburb service. \u00a0The food is amazing. \u00a0Someone who knew what he was doing took charge of the ordering and did a commendable job. \u00a0Fantastic food. \u00a0On the must return list.","1069":"Great northern Indian with smart service in a nicely appointed facility. \u00a0All the dishes as expected served fresh and hot with care. \u00a0A little on the pricey side for Indian but it's all done very well.","1070":"Definitely higher priced for Indian food, but then again I always feel like a princess when eating here. The atmosphere is very upscale, and I love all the deep, rich colors. The wine list is extensive, and the food is refined Indian food. Everything I have had is delicious here. I would highly recommend it for a fine dining Indian experience.","1071":"On the pricy side of Indian fare, but then this is not ordinary Indian fare. The food was delicate, correctly spiced and well cooked. Kudos to the chef. On the A list when I am in Singapore.I have not tried the buffet which does not get rave reviews but then what do you expect. Go for the menu, sit back and enjoy a culinary delight.","1072":"Was there on 14 March 2015..think they are either moving or or about to renovate.. No one answered the call.Closed. Several outlets still around. Thank Godness!","1073":"Had the half chicken with a personal order of the yummy rice. It tasted good to me, I wouldn't wait in a long line for it but still very good. The Maxwell location was closed so we opted for this location. I prefer this location because it has a\/c. That's something nice to have on the hot Singapore days. The chicken is tasty and the rice is pretty impressive. I recommend this to anybody going to Singapore","1074":"Hooray for having an outlet of the famous Tian Tian near my place!In a way, this is an upgrade from the original stall in Maxwell, as it's an actual restaurant space that's air conditioned. They also have a menu that looks pretty substantial; lots to look through with more offerings. I wouldn't be surprised if the other offerings are good, but I still prefer sticking to my favourite chicken rice at $3.80.The basic $3.80 order comes with chicken rice and some soup. It's been a while since I've been to the stall, but I'm unsure if they offer ginger or not as there was none offered on the table. The dark sauce and chilli sauce were in abundance, though!I usually come here during off peak times, but when I've usually passed by, I don't notice any long, snaking queues like in CBD. If you need your fix and you're in the east, you're in luck!","1075":"Described as one of Singapore's staple food, we had to try hainan chicken rice on our visit. Glad we got to try this - small place, super quick service and a cheap eat. The chicken is indeed very tender and juicy.","1076":"This is not the famous branch of Tian Tian but the same delicious Hainanese Chicken Rice is offered here. Compared to my other favorite in Singapore, Boon Tong Kee, I personally think they're on par and that any preference in the differences are really dependent on your own taste buds.The rice here is more flavorful but also a tad more oily and salty. So if you're health-conscious in any way, this may not be a good option for you. The chicken is great, served at the appropriate temperature, and a good amount.This location is air-conditioned so you can eat in the cool comfort and a relatively good size. I'm really glad that a friend took me to try their food. I was extremely pleased with what I consumed that evening and I would recommend it to anyone visiting.","1077":"The Maxwell Food Centre location was closed when I went there to try the infamous \u00a0Hainanese chicken, but I came across this location by accident while exploring the neighborhood my hotel was located in. I was happy to see that I would not have to wait in line here!! The chicken itself is juicy and served chilled, which I had read is done so on purpose. The rice is very flavorful and compliments the chicken. The soup was the biggest disappointment of the meal. Overall, my own opinion is there is better Hainanese chicken to be had elsewhere. Evertop was my favorite place for this dish on my visit.","1078":"1. Half white, roasted chicken ($14)- preferred the roasted chicken to the white one which was a bit too fatter\/oily tasting. - so much chicken!!! if this was half, i wouldn't dare see what is 1 full chicken 2. Hainanese Chicken Chop ($7) - Crispy! - the sweet sauce on it complimented it well too. - only complain was the sauce made the initially crispy chicken chops soggy after awhile. probably should have asked for the sauce to be served separately. 3. Sambal kangkong- bad. the veg doesn't taste fresh :( This store is supposedly very \"famous\" but I don't see what all the hyper is about. its chicken rice pretty ordinary. Would return for item 2 though.","1079":"Unlike the other outlets, here's a place not just offering chicken rice but there's a kitchenette offering some hainanese dishes. I tried the hainanese chap chye, which is great alternative to the usual oyster sauce vegetables. It was a more flavourful option to the usual teochew chap chye that I would have and it is not as salty as the oyster sauce vegetables. I particularly enjoy the beansprouts with cuttlefish, which is a classic offering at all outlets. There is a good crunch and fresh breansprouts unlike some stalls with thin miserable sprouts swimming in an oily gravy. I like the interiors at this outlet, the white walls are inviting and the big tables make it ideal for group lunches and dinners and there is free on-site parking for patrons! You can also call to reserve or order a pick up if you are in a rush, service is rather friendly and swift too!","1080":"A favourite place for me to bring my tourist friends because they get to try the famous chicken rice (which I reckon is done really well here), along with other dishes that you won't be able to get if you had chicken rice at a hawker centre \/ food court, and in the comfort of air-conditioning. We always get half a roast chicken and half steamed - portions are generous you won't be disappointed! Some of the other dishes that I really like are the sweet potato leaves, beansprouts with salted fish and sweet and sour fish. There's also free parking for customers right outside the store - but parking is very limited so come early on a weekday, otherwise be prepared to park elsewhere and walk - parking is quite a hassle in congested Joo Chiat unfortunately.","1081":"The famous chicken rice stall in Maxwell Tian Tian, has a walk in restaurant on Joo Chiat Rd. Same fantastic cold cut steamed white chicken, fragrant rice and well balanced chili as its famous Maxwell counterpart. Though add a minimalistic restaurant fit out, with comfy chairs, good aircon and decent service and it now provides a more rounded experience than lining up in a dirty, crowded and hot hawker center. Mind you, it doesn't mean that there isn't the occasional queue at the door waiting for a table. They have a few side dishes and things like pork belly and porridge available, though who really walks into a place like this looking for more than chicken rice. The service here is surprisingly of a good standard for similar places and concepts. A must visit whenever I'm in the Joo Chiat Rd vicinity. Do take not though they are closed on Mondays.","1082":"I ordered char siew rice. It was probably the BEST char siew I've ever had. It came with a pretty big chops too and it was only $3.50++ any place with unlimited garlic-garlic sauce\/dipping always has an extra value to me","1083":"A very average plate of chicken rice. I think most people associate Tiong Bahru with old school traditional good local food, or at least I did. I just wanted a simple quick lunch and it was fairly empty at 2ish pm. I ordered the chicken rice set which included a small plate of veggies. The only highlight would be the vegetables which were fresh and sweet and crunchy. At least they were not limp and overcooked. The rice was so-so, lacking the fragrance of chicken rice. The roasted chicken was not too bad, tender and deboned, making it easy to eat. Plus there was no layer of fats under the skin. The chili sauce which was the critical component of a good chicken rice was a bit mild. It did not have the oommph to take it to the next level, likewise for the ginger. Besides chicken rice (white and roasted), it also served curry rice. I think most diners were having chicken rice when I was there. Maybe that would be the better choice. I would eat here only if there were no other options.","1084":"So bad so bad.I tried the lunch set C which has pork chop, a side of cabbage, plus a whole fried fish. Sounds like great value at $5.50..but what's the point when it is so bad. I never had a thinner pork fillet. The pork chop has more flour than pork. It might as well be just fried flour. The fried fish is a whole fish...it''s ok I guess.Most people were eating the chicken rice. Maybe I should have just went for the norm instead of being adventurous. But it's going to take a while before I head back.","1085":"It's an okay chicken rice. Not great, not good, but not bad. Still a touch better than food court chicken rice. The steamed chicken is a little lean but still tasty with oily skin. It is also a bit bloodier than others. Not very bloody. But you notice it. The good thing about this place is the big menu. They also have lor ba, fried tofu, porridge, all kinds of sides and side dishes. It's conveniently located and feeds the office crowd in the area.","1086":"Ordered a steamed chicken set, with pork fillet and some vegetables. The vegetables is a little salty, the pork chop fillet only has tastes of the flour and salty stuff there is no meat tasted at all. The set menu isn't that value for money after all due to the little meat they give. I guess, working crowds at the central really doesn't have much of a choice for good food nowadays that they have to succumb to this.","1087":"First things first, this stall is at ABC Brickworks food centre (you can probably tell if you read the address\/looked at the location map) Few hokkien mee stalls manage to dish out such nice noodles as this elderly couple. He goes for a more \"wet\" style (aka more gravy), and best of all, his gravy is flavorful. You can taste the hours of boiling prawn shells in the gravy, and coupled with the noodles that have a bit of the bite (or what some of us term as \"QQ\"). In addition, I'm not sure if intentionally or unintentionally, there's a slight burnt taste, similar to how good hor fun is cooked, and that adds a new dimension to the taste as well! Oh, and be careful of the chill. Do NOT underestimate its spiciness (well, my tolerance is below average - but not poor :P)However, you may \"get sick\" (what locals term as \"ni\") of it so don't order sooo much. I ordered $6 portion to share between 2 people and I wished I only ordered the $4 portion instead.","1088":"So I bookmarked this place when I was last in Singapore four months ago and completely forgot to stop by. Luckily, I had another chance on my current trip and am so happy I finally did. I've never tried Putu Piring before today and to be honest, wasn't even all that sure what to expect. They're flat discs of coconut filled with a concoction of palm sugar then steamed and served with banana leaf. They're soft, fluffy, slightly sweet and served warm. It was unlike anything I've eaten before and was super delicious served alongside grated coconut. They're made fresh on the spot so expect a small wait. Cost is so cheap, $2 for 5 (considered one serve). Totally worth giving a try and now one of my favorite places for cheap eats in Singapore.","1089":"I guess it alright. I bookmark this place when travel to Singapore. Get to tried out the food stand here. The dessert are ok but the portion is small. It super hot in this eateries with a lot of fans on the ceiling but it doesn't help to relief the heat at all. I was sitting eating the foods but sweat like I just got out of the stream room.","1090":"It is a nice traditional dessert that seems less known by foreigners. Please come and try, you will feel it's simple and traditional way to treat foods.","1091":"A nice piece of food heritage! I've always being a fan of the \"Chinese\" tutu kueh but this brings me even greater satisfaction. The fluffy rice flour cake with a delicious gula melaka filing and sprinkled generously with fresh shredded coconut \u00a0and pandan leaves - a taste of heaven and still very reasonably price!","1092":"I am not a grated coconut person, but this is totally awesome!The palm sugar is fragrant and just of the right sweetness. There is always a line at all hours of the day, but unless you are stuck behind someone who is buying 100 packets, the line usually moves quite fast.Everything is made upon order! You can't get anything fresher than that!","1093":"A hidden and lost ethnic pastry found within Mr Teh Tarik coffeeshop. This award-winning stall has and will definitely bring delight and childhood memories to many who have outlived the 60s to 80s. Manned by a group of muslim ladies dressed in white and adorned with gold jewelry, one can't help but to be amused by the apparent contrast in perceived value between gold and the simple and inexpensive pastry. Flour filled with gula melaka (sweet brown sugar) and accompanied with coconut shavings, this tasty treat is made on the spot and best served hot. Get ready to join in the queue!","1094":"Fantastic! Freshly made on the spot. Traditional taste you can trust. The skin is soft and the filling generous and explosive. These are the real deals not those you see in Pasar Malam. Price is also very reasonable for the size and number of pieces you get. Downside is it is not very near the train station but still walkable. Singaporeans walk anywhere for good food right?","1095":"Unique Peranakan food!\u00a0 True Blue is in a great old (100 year old) building.\u00a0 It has an old Singapore feel.\u00a0 Very friendly staff, great food, and a bit spicey.\u00a0 Make sure to ask the staff when ordering.\u00a0 They do a great job sterring you to the best dishes.\u00a0 Worth coming back!Tip: ask the staff about the history and decorations and furnature.\u00a0 They all are part of what old Singapore is about.","1096":"Will not come back again. Over-priced for low standard peranakan food. Nice setting with some peranakan decorations. The Peranakan Museum next door is a must visit. Go somewhere else for real good peranakan food.","1097":"Tried egg wrap, delicious, had a crunch and fish sauce flavor. Very interesting and tasty. Wish I tried more.","1098":"A beautiful restaurant transformed from a 100-year old mansion. The blue wall and old-time decor conjured up the fondest of fin de si\u00e8cle.The food tasted quite strange and salty. It may be the reason that taste is acquired and my palate was not yet cultivated. The much recommended stewed chicken with black nuts looked dark and felt like Chinese medicine. The cured black nuts were not nutty and yet salty and bitter.Spicy banana blossom salad: refreshing and crispy. They used the flower of bananas to make the salad, and therefore blossom in the title.Crab and chicken meat soup: the meatball was not chewy and the meat was hard and starchy. Pass.Rendang beef: lack of the rendang flavor and the meat was a bit too lean.The only highlight the night was a cabbage stew with mushroom and black fungus. And of course, the fresh durian- I got a dollop of it as a side. One of my friends had to step out while I was eating the stinky fruit, because he could not stand the smell. Haha.. people are so different ;)","1099":"During our trip to Singapore last week, our friend who lives there recommended this restaurant if we wanted to try local (Peranakan) cuisine. My wife, her sister and husband and I went there for lunch. We loved the food and great service. We did not know much about Peranakan cuisine. So, we asked the restaurant staff to recommend what we should eat. Everything was fantastic!! The salad, soup, chicken with nuts (incredible), prawns, etc.If you are in Singapore, we highly recommend this restaurant. The exterior and interior are like a museum. Beautiful!! Don't rush it. Enjoy the food and atmosphere. Then go to the Peranakan Museum afterwards or before if you have time.

Charming place with great atmosphere.","1101":"This is a very unique restaurant with multi blended ethnic foods coming together. the menu is not overwhelming so you can take your time enjoy several things. Poisonous nuts when cooked properly they're not poisonous.Great food scene in Singapore.","1102":"First, I can not write this review without considering another review that I need to compose. \u00a0That is for Blue Ginger, another Peranakan restaurant I recently visited.I've eaten at True Blue twice. \u00a0While the same exact food was ordered each time, the experience was considerably different.I will start with the consistencies. \u00a0This is with the food and ambiance. \u00a0Each time, the exact same dishes were ordered. \u00a0Each time, the food was simply amazing.The spicy banana flower salad. \u00a0I find this dish to be very refreshing and the presentation is quite lovely. \u00a0There is a mixture of \u00a0sweet, savoury, and spicy that comes together just right.tinyurl.com\/9efxpoeThe first time I ever tried Chicken with Buah Keluak (black nut) was at True Blue. \u00a0I fell in love with the dish. \u00a0The richness of the Buah Keluak is simply amazing. \u00a0I've been told it is an acquired taste. \u00a0If so, my acquisition skills must be very good. \u00a0Because, from my first bite, I just wanted more. \u00a0The chicken is cooked perfectly. \u00a0It is simply a little pot of goodness. \u00a0If I had a complaint it would be that there could be more of it.tinyurl.com\/8ehbqj6tinyurl.com\/9ms74heThen there is the Tiger Prawns with curry leaves. \u00a0What can I say? \u00a0They are huge. \u00a0They are sweet and delicate. \u00a0They are as close to being lobster tail as you can get without being from a lobster.tinyurl.com\/9scmpraI think the food at True Blue is very good.The other consistency is the room itself. \u00a0It is a beautiful room. \u00a0It has charm. \u00a0It feels as if you are in someone's home. \u00a0The very high ceilings give the room a feeling of space. \u00a0You feel like you have stepped back in time.Now, I must note the key inconsistency.The first time, I went with a regular who was introducing me to the restaurant. \u00a0The meal was well-paced and relaxed. \u00a0Dishes came and dishes went. \u00a0The staff was very attentive. \u00a0Overalll, it was a very pleasurable meal.The second time, I took a friend to introduce her to the restaurant. \u00a0 We arrived and we were quickly seated. \u00a0Soon after we ordered. \u00a0In just a few moments, the food began to arrive. \u00a0When I say food, I mean all of it. \u00a0It was all brought out at the same time. \u00a0There was no pacing. \u00a0It was not really a dining experience as much as it was simply eating. \u00a0We were finished in 30 minutes.True Blue is not an inexpensive restaurant. \u00a0I do not mind paying well for great dining experiences. \u00a0But, dining isn't only about the food. \u00a0If it was, I would eat every meal at a hawker centre. \u00a0When I am paying for an expensive meal, I expect it to feel like a experience. \u00a0 It is a shame. It was great food served in a great ambiance. \u00a0But, it felt like a fast food experience.If my second trip had matched my first one, I would be giving True Blue five stars. \u00a0My next trip will determine if they should retain their current four stars.The food is amazing. \u00a0The flavors are great. \u00a0The presentation is very good. \u00a0The room is beautiful. \u00a0There just needs to be more attention given to the overall experience.","1103":"Nice flavor Nonya Food, beautiful decor, very little portion but OVERLY charged! $3 Singapore dollars per person for the rice , I didn't even touch the rice , they charged us $12 because we have 4 people! $4 per person for tea, &28 for a small fried fish! A very small dish pomelo about 100g cover with one table spoon peanuts is $18!Prawn cracker $1 per person ,black nuts chicken $24 , we asked them to add 2 nuts they charged us $4 per two nuts, anyway total $228.34 without wine!You can have this kind of food at other \u00a0Pararakan Food for May be 1\/2 price or even less . \u00a0If you want to try their god be ready for the high payment!","1104":"This is my all-time favorite Peranakan restaurant in Singapore. \u00a0From the moment you spot the storefront it's like a journey back in time. \u00a0The beautiful white orchids greet you as you pass through the small door into the entrance way. \u00a0There you start to immerse yourself in the gorgeous surrounding of a heritage Peranakan shophouse.  Last night we dined with a couple of friends of my cousin who are in town for business. \u00a0Luckily they are adventurous eaters. \u00a0They did have trouble finding it but seemed to enjoy the plush surrounds. \u00a0We sat in the corner with a full view of the restaurant and the china collection cabinet. \u00a0We ordered our favorites: the banana blossom & cucumber salad, sweet potato leaves, okra in candlenut sauce, black nut chicken, fried chicken in Indonesian spices, and beef rending. \u00a0The dishes came out of the kitchen at a steady pace. \u00a0Rice and tea were refilled plentifully. \u00a0I drank so much of the red date & longan tea that I had a mild sugar high mid meal. I cannot speak highly enough of the banana salad. \u00a0I have never been able to identify the banana blossom in the dish but the sauce is so good I don't really care what is in it. \u00a0I usually polish off the dish myself while people focus their attention elsewhere. \u00a0Like hollowing out their black nuts and chicken. \u00a0This is another stunning dish here. \u00a0The chicken is infused with more of the black nit flavor than other versions of this dish I have tasted. \u00a0The beef rending is simply superb. \u00a0I don't care for fried chicken but our guests fought over the last piece so it must have been delicious. plates clean the dessert came: pineapple tarts and some mango puree and pomelo for me. I hadn't gotten enough of pomelo from the juice which was amazing. \u00a0The pineapple tarts are homemade and you can tell. \u00a0Our guests commented that it didn't taste like pineapple at all. Either way, they ate them with delight. \u00a0We sat for a long time after the meal in deep conversation about the country. \u00a0The atmosphere in this restaurant makes you want to talk about important things. \u00a0After holding the table for over two hours we departed. \u00a0But it won't be long before I'm back for that salad.","1105":"5-star setting, pity about the foodTrue Blue is possibly the prettiest Nonya matriach in town. Gorgeous artwork such as the beaded slippers are displayed in one of the rooms, while another houses a breathtaking array of lace blouses. The ground floor seating area is the main hall, while a few private rooms upstairs and one on the ground floor are popular for wedding ceremonies and private events.Pity then that the food and service appear indifferent and lacking in soul. Ayam buah keluak was the best dish, while everything else really failed to exhibit depth of flavour. The beef rendang was tough and barely warm when it hit the table, the chap chye watery. Prawns petai style were not fresh and lacked in sambal. Oh and if you want extra sambal, you will have to pay for it. Not surprising then with the small sizes of the dishes that the bill quickly adds up. Desserts were overhyped; the \"best pineapple tart in Singapore\" was mediocre with its dried out jam centre not yielding any moistness.This is a really beautiful restaurant to bring overseas guests, but only the connoisseur will know that there are smaller, more boutique Peranakan restaurants serving far better quality dishes.","1106":"Condescending service with really bad service. Staff was rushing us to leave even though it was just 9.30pm and started turning off the lights. Extremely surprising experience given the price point and posh positioning of the restaurant. Food was fantastic though, although I value service above the quality of food. Verdict: Go for it only if you want to enjoy the food and be prepared for nasty service.","1107":"Excellent traditional peranakan cuisine in a beautiful traditional Chinese house setting. \u00a0The food is authentic and has all the right variety of selection (the service staffs were helpful and knowledgable about the dishes). \u00a0It takes you back to the golden time of an era with photos from the past! \u00a0Recommended esp for taking friends to have a peranakan experience!","1108":"wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?be afraid, be really afraid, whispered the masses.and so afraid i was that only recently did i try them out.well, you see, fear is but a choice and once i chose not to fear, the reward is sweet!a sweet, rich, fresh prawns broth, full of garlicky goodness with a subtle hint of spiciness.wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?to me, uncle is a friendly father figure.a survival of two major operations, thanks in part to surgeon customers in our midst.aunty can be sweet too, IF you follow a few simple rules:1) do stay at least one metre away from the stall when queuing.2) do speak only when spoken to3) do not try to cut queue.4) do come back in good time or stay within visual range after you have placed your order as they will only make your order when they know you are ready to collect immediately.5) do not mess up her stall by spilling the chilli infused soy sauce or the precious prawn broth when collecting your order. 6) do not return the tray, as they pay good money for trays to be returned to them via cleaners.wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?well, they do hoard some of the biggest prawns for a hawker stall and i am thankful for that.if you can afford to spare a twenty, just go for the biggest bowl that they sell!it is big enough for sharing although you only get 3 BIG prawns.as for the carb selection, that is a personal preference.but i do like their dry mee kia, laden with crispy shallots and lardons.i have also discovered a sweet spot on saturday mornings just before 9am whereby i will encounter the shortest possible queue.so far, so good and hopefully it will stay as such even after this review goes out?wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?all hail, uncle and aunty!;)","1109":"Now when it comes to Prawn Mee, the one thing I think we can all agree on, is that the tastes and preferences of our locals differs quite substantially. Everyone has an opinion on how the best prawn Mee should taste like.Believe me when I said that I've tried many \"famous\" places since the 80s till now. Shops have come and gone, newer ones or the better marketed (through social media or word of mouth) has made their way to the limelight and are sometimes over hyped. I'm caught in between opinions when it comes to this store and here's my experience -I was lucky enough to join the queue on a Saturday morning minutes before noon and only queued about 30mins for this ( I heard it can be up to an hour plus). The stall is runned by an elderly couple. The uncle prepares all the food in the background and the Aunty takes orders and collect the cash. I heard the Aunty can get a little grumpy but with all grumpy old folks I don't really take any offence and laugh it off as cute.\"Aunty! 2 $10 bowl! 1Meepok 1kwaytiao! Dry ah! :)\"\"Don't have $10 already! Sold out! Got $15! Today the prawn very good! Fresh and big! Ah!\"\"Ok la Aunty! Gimme 2 $15 bowl then la :D\"I then proceed to wait another 5-7mins before receiving 2 bowls of dried chilli noodles and another 2 mini woks of 3 giant prawns each. Verdict: Soup indeed tastes very healthy. You can distinctively taste the sweetness of the boiled prawn heads in the broth. However I'm used to having my soup a little bit more on the saltier side when it comes to prawn Mee. (I guess I grew up that way) their dry noodles are like your usual market type Mee pok with chilli or kway teow with chilli. Nothing special. The star of the show goes to the prawns! They were big! They were juicy! They were cruncy! Not the least bit dry and cooked to absolute perfection! If you are craving for damn good prawns without going to a seafood restaurant, this is THE PLACE!But with the long wait, and location... It's not something that tells me \"I MUST come back IMMEDIATELY\" after I've had my last scoop of soup.Maybe in a few months times perhaps.. But I still have a favourite prawn Mee stall that keeps me going, but this isn't it. 3.6 STARS","1110":"Pek Kio food centre is famous for many local hawker fare. The name 'Pek Kio' is actually Chinese dialect for 'white bridge', which was how the locals described Cambridge back in the days. Many of the stalls here have long histories and with that, long queues. One of the most famous is Wah Kee Prawn Noodles, famed for its LARGE prawns and LONG queues.Though I'm not a big fan for soupy prawn noodle, I can understand the fuss about this stall. The prawn soup is thick and fragrant, while the prawns are big and juicy. And when I say big, I mean BIG big. It is often rated as the best prawn noodle stall in Singapore and its hard to disagree. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the super long queues.","1111":"The prawn noodles used to be much better. The soup richer and more flavorful. And the old auntie used to bring your noodles to your table, with a pack of complimentary tissue.Now the lines are crazy long. The soup is still reddish from the prawn head roe...but the soup base tasted more watered down than the good old days.Note: if you prefer mee kia (thin noodles), you have to come early as they are usually out of that by noon. After which, I will go for my second choice of noodles-beehoon.","1112":"When I crave for prawn mee, this is where I go for my fix. The soup stock is rich and flavorful, and the prawns are big. I always order the most expensive bowl, that has the biggest prawns--they serve the prawns and noodles in two separate bowls.I normally go there for an early or late lunch to avoid the long Q.","1113":"KenScale: 9.5\/10The best meal I had during my stay in Singapore also happened to be the most expensive one. I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (\"Ghin\" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!","1114":"Amazing food, great service and superb wine pairing. My favorite was the cold noodle at the end of the meal. It was surprising refreshing.","1115":"There is a reason why this place is ranked as one of the Top 50 restaurants in the world. A culinary experience not to be missed!","1116":"Never thought I would say this, but I found a downside to spontaneity. And that is: can't get reservations anywhere!So I figured I'll just eat at the bar. It's a la carte at the bar. There's both counter and tables at the bar. Ordered the steak. It was okay. The sauce was too sweet, which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak. Normally I love sweet sauce on anything, so I don't know what they did wrong with this sauce. Just didn't go.Perhaps, the food is better not at the bar, but after this steak, I'm not dying to come back.","1117":"My life is complete...I ate off of the bar menu at Waku Ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range. Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni\/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu.","1118":"Waku Ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy. It will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it's just so much food. Also, be sure to set aside 3.5 to 4 hours to dine here, it's long. Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable. I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the \"menu\", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal. You say OK and move on with your culinary journey.Both of my experiences, I had essentially the same dishes (I believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season). I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience.","1119":"I guess our expectations were different and we didn't have the required refined tastes to enjoy the meal. We were a party of 6, had the omakase ofc, some v expensive sake, and 6xS$20 of still water?!?Overall i was dissapointed. Maybe I did not enjoy the subtleness of the 10 well-presented courses enough but honestly I was expecting to be wowed but in the end I came away with 3000 reasons why I could have eaten elsewhere for 5* food but much much better value.The uni was decent and the a5 wagyu was ok but everything else was sub-par and honestly not worth the $400++ ?don't forget gst + service) we paid per person. However our chef from Japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally-supposed ta be-haute-gastronomic experience.Like the new hublot ferrari engine watch. Or not.O well. At least they had phone charger for my poor Android phone..*also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi :(( but o well i guess u can't choose in omakase.","1120":"dear wakuda san,i hope this letter finds you well.my father won big by taking germany to win the world cup and so was able to dine in your restaurant last night.coincidentally, it was his birthday but alas he dined WITHOUT ME, as he said you were too expensive for kids to tag along:(the first thing he said, when i saw him this morning was,\"son, you need to study really hard and make sure that you can speak clearly and communicate properly!\"i was perplexed.but apparently, the uncles and aunties who served him last night weren't able to do so without him constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said, again and again.despite that, service was still good but communications was a big F.i guess your exquisite culinary creations have to speak for themselves?!the awkward teppanyaki counter setup further detracted from the dining experience as it proved more of an obstacle to service rather than a chance to showcase your gourmet menu.frankly speaking, there were no knives flying nor fancy schmancy cooking skills that warrants the teppanyaki counter's existence.anything he had, from the teppan, could easily have been cooked in the kitchen.the only good thing about it was he got to snap more shots for posting on Yelp!he also mentioned another uncle customer commented on how you no longer cook your abalone dish at the counter anymore.so it's just the canadian lobster, tasmanian cape grim beef and japanese ohmi wagyu beef that benefited from the under utilized, obtrusive teppan.you are probably better off without it!BUT obviously, he LOVED your food!5 stars for that alone!he flew to sydney just to dine at your flagship restaurant and has been ever so effusive about your delicate cooking that incorporates the best produce and is always full of flavours!just check out his gazillion photos(when he gets round to uploading them all) and you can't help but click on 'LIKE'!he said that it looks as good as it tastes or is it the other way around?!anyway, just when he thought dinner was over, you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts!the pre-dessert kyoho grapes and granita was simple but amazing, so sweet yet with a tinge of sour and the icy granita kept those seedless halves just firm enough before melting away in your mouth!the dessert proper was a mango passion fruit cremet d'anjou, not properly explained and he had to refer to the menu they printed out for him, it was quality but nothing mind blowing.then he was surprised with what looks like your signature chocolate cake with perfectly scribbled chocolate birthday wishes! thank you for saving me the trouble of having to buy him a birthday cake!i mean the cake i buy, can never come close to the velvety finish that he mentioned in passing.finally, your petit cinq completed a lovely evening of gastronomy.even though he was so full, he still popped every single one into his mouth instead of bringing some home for me!:(uncle, you kept him away for a good 3 hours but that was a good thing as it allowed the bottle of tsuki no katsura iwaimai, nigori, junmai daiginjo to vanish and for him to depart on a sake high.thank you for making it an overall memorable evening for him.yours sincerely,nik juniorp.s. hopefully, he does not have to wait till the next world cup to be back again!;)","1121":"Located in the glitzy expanse of Marina Bay Sands, Waku Ghin definitely offers culinary decadence. The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time. I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place. The staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests.","1122":"Waku Ghin. Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening.","1123":"Amazing food. \u00a0Watching the preparation was great too. \u00a0Overall a fantastic experience!","1124":"In the world of celebrity chefs, Tetsuya Wakuda is up there with the best in the world. \u00a0Many of us have had the privilege of dining at his Sydney restaurant, Tetsuya's, but how many of us have had the opportunity to dine at his Singapore restaurant, Waku Ghin? \u00a0Well, now, I can add myself to those lucky people. Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu. \u00a0The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience. \u00a0In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world. \u00a0Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff. \u00a0To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side. \u00a0Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space. \u00a0Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening. \u00a0Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms. \u00a0This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu. \u00a0We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us. \u00a0I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list. \u00a0If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat. \u00a0I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive! \u00a0At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along. \u00a0I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food. \u00a0Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth! \u00a0Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction. \u00a0 Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert. \u00a0The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening. \u00a0We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening. \u00a0A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience. \u00a0From the food, to the decor, to the service. \u00a0This is seamless top class dining. \u00a0This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come.","1125":"A place for high-rollersAt $400 per head before taxes, Waku Ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner. (And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ \/10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite. \u00a0For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well.","1126":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Singapore. the ambiance and the food, defines what good dining experience should be. It is expensive and reservations are hard to come by, but its worth it.","1127":"... We love Japanese Food ... And we love Waku Ghin ..t ambiance is frendly but can be formal n stiff .. Depends on t company ypu are with. Food is always good .. T few times ?'? bin der .. It has been most satisfactory ... Love it","1128":"Fabulous dining experience at Whitegrass. Wonderful knowledgeable staff. We did the 5 course tasting and it was extraordinary. We have many \"snacks\" in between courses that rivaled the mains. My favorite among themWas the ying and yang dish. The broth and balance of this dish was out of this world. It was an umami flavor that will never be forgotten. Each dish is a feast for you eyes and was unique and delicious in its own right. I would highly recommend doing the wine pairing with this tasting menu as just one bottle is not going to pair with all dishes. We really enjoyed trying all the wines. The cab was among our favorites and was paired with my husbands Australian Wagu. Unfortunately I was feeling a bit under the weather this evening but we did not want to miss out on dining at Whitegrass as we were only in Singapore one night. It was well worth the trip. Thank you Whitegrass for an amazing meal and evening.","1129":"The restaurant was known for its modern Australian cuisine, and located in Chijmes. Service was swift and smooth. I was shown to a sofa seat table with cushion around. Looking at the menu, I decided on the 3-course lunch set ($64++).The meal started with an amuse-bouche which was the chef's version of the korean bibimbap. It consisted of nori cream made with creme fraiche and nori, compressed cucmber sphere, cured trout roe, chrysanthemum petals, puffed wild rice, toasted nori, cherry bell radish, and dashi jelly. It was a party in the mouth.Roasted Mangalica pork jowl, sea scallop xo, braised wombok, land seaweedInterestingly the scallop was flattened into translucent silky sheet, which looked similar to Liang fen ??, but it still retained the scallop's seafood taste. The chinese cabbage was braised in a milky creamy sauce. The pork was fork tender and flavourful.Line caught red seabream, sago porridge, fermented celeriac, young herbs, umami butterThe dish was prettily served topped with cucumber's flowers. The sago porridge sat on a pool of herb oil, topped with the fish. The sago porridge was creamy and crunchy with vegetables in it. It smelt umami when served.Australian berries, young coconut mousse, lychee granita, dried milkThe mousse was light not too sweet, which was quite balance with the slightly tart berries.The meal ended with a serving of petite four which consisted of a macaron and a tart with crispy noodle like base.I also ordered a cup of latte ($7++) to go with it.Overall the food was delicious and unique in its own way.","1130":"Don't let the slightly stuffy decor fool you...the food, wine, value and service for a Michelin starred restaurant is outstanding. Exceptional food and service if you are in the mood for degustation.","1131":"he is samsam aisbettthat sam-he-isthat sam from the quay!i do likethat sam-he-isdo you likesashimi of yellowtail amberjack, horseradish, toasted nori oil, salted radish, nasturtium, white soy dressing?exquisitely light, fresh as sea and delicately balanced, what a start!i do like them,sam-he-is.i do likesalad of slow roasted young beetroots, smoked eel, late season cherries, rosella jam, australian mountain pepper!non beet lovers may so voice their objections and a hokkaido scallop dish from their 8 course menu will be a more than reasonable replacement. in fact, those who had the beet dish wished they had the scallop dish instead!would you like themhere or there?i did like themhere or there.i did like themanywhere.i do likeslow cooked mangalica pork, tiger abalone, fermented cabbage, white turnip, fiddlehead fern, seaweed and pork broth this for me was the highlight of my meal, flawless, melt in the mouth coupled with a complex combination of flavours.i do like them,sam-he-is!would you like themin whitegrass?would you like themwith a sake glass?i do like themin whitegrass.i do like themwith a sake glass.i do like themhere or there.i do like themanywhere.i do like full blood wagyu from australia's limestone coast, master stock braised beef tendon and tongue, toasted organic wheat, shitake, pickled chinese artichoke, burnt celeriac.do note that the flat and not the curved side of the knife(just for this dish) is the cutting edge!perfectly cooked albeit just a touch saltier than it should be.i do like them, sam-he-is!would you eat themin a box?would you eat themwith a fox?yes in a box.yes with a fox.yes in whitegrass.yes with a sake glass.i would eat them here or there.i would eat them anywhere.i would eat young coconut mousse, jackfruit ice cream, longan, almond and ginger cake.deconstructed, looking more like a bingsu.those quality roasted almonds gave a great crunchy nutty difference.i do like them, sam-he-is.would you? could you?in a car?eat them! eat them!here at chijmes they are.i would,could,in a caryou may like them.you will see.you may like themin a tree?i would, could in a tree.not in a car! you let me be.i do like them in a box.i do like them with a foxi do like them in whitegrassi do like them with a sake glassi do like them here or there.i do like them anywhere.i do like their rye sourdough freshly baked warm bread with smooth rich echire butter.i do like them, sam-he-is!a sake! a sake!a sake! a sake!could you, would youdine here with a sake?yes a sake! isaribi sake!yes a sake! sam! let isaribi be!i would, could, in a box.i could, would, with a fox.i will eat them with a sake glassi will eat them in whitegrass.i will eat them here or there.i will eat them anywhere.i do like them, sam-he-is!i do so liketheir interior decor!less than formal but with plentiful classy and arty touch.thank you!thank you,sam-he-is!","1132":"Awesome food, awesome hospitality, great location, eye for detail design, we will be back","1133":"The flavors and seasonings are on point. I got my prawn noodles dry with soup on the side. The prawns were disappointing because they are not big like the name states. However, the flavors made up for it. The soup is delicious with a great sweet seafood taste. You can even see the red prawn juices floating on top. The original and simplest is the prawn mee, but you can also opt for pork rib, liver, etc. They come in 4 to 5 different sizes to please all palates. The line is long and it takes forever to get your order. Don't be fooled if the line looks short, because everyone who has already ordered is sitting around waiting for their noodles. After you order, you're given a laminated number in which the owner will shout out in Mandarin and English when your order is ready. It took 40 mins to get to the front of the line and about another 30 minutes to get my bowl of noodles. I didn't mind because I could munch on all the other delicious snacks in the nearby stalls. The seating is first come, first serve. You can reserve a seat by placing a packet of tissue on the table. I guess that's proper hawker etiquette. Don't be weirded out if others sit at your table too. It's all communal seating.","1134":"Pretty good value for $4. I came to Old Airport today with the intention of eating something else. It was closed. So I tried this. The soup is v flavourful. For 2 large prawns split into half, at this price, cannot complain","1135":"Big Prawn Noodle with pork ribs. This noodle soup taste great, you will be able to smell the fresh prawn soup while standing in waiting for your noodle bowl. There are two stalls selling this concoction but the other stall version seems a tad too oily. You may also like that oily version as it also has a line there. For the price you get several half prawns plus four pieces pork rib. The amount of noodle is little for $5. The soup was the best part of the meal and worth the price. You can taste the freshness of the prawn and the pork oil taste does not over power the flavour.If only they gave more noodle, they may get ful marks.","1136":"Amazing vegan peranakan food! Almost 100% vegan except one dish has honey and they specify which so if you're vegan this place is great. The flavors of our dishes were all great and not too heavy or greasy. All my non veg friends enjoyed the food a lot! I recommend all their famous dishes like the rendang (made with mushrooms not mock meat), cereal tofu (WOWWW like cereal prawns but with tofu) and the kangkong belachan (which is hard to find vegan)! The restaurant is really nice on the inside and conveniently located right outside the Tanjong pagar MRT. I would come back here again! Really yummy veg food","1137":"Whole Earth was founded in 2003, is the first and only Peranakan-Thai Vegetarian in Singapore.They are the only plant based restaurant in Singapore to be awarded the inaugural Michelin Bib Gourmand 2016, thus it is hardly that Vegetarians out there will find them unfamiliar.Interior was modernly furnished, giving a clean and neat environment. On the other hand, service is good and did not disappoint.Lemongrass (Hot \/ Cold) - $6Since Chinese New Year is around the corner, we ordered their Yu Sheng and enjoyed the session.Prosperity Yu Sheng - $48 If you were thinking where are the \"Yu\" in the plate. Here's the mocked salmon and abalone.Like any other restaurants that offers Yu Sheng, the staff will open up the individual ingredients and before mixing into the plate, she will say out of the words of blessing and meanings that each ingredient represent. This is the first time I'm having Vegetarian Yu Sheng and it looks quite interesting with Dou Miao included.Brown Rice is just too mainstream for us and we had ordered the Signature Olive Brown Rice to complement the rest of the dishes ordered. Fragrant and delicious, without being too oily.Signature Olive Brown Rice \u00a0???????? - $11 (Small)Tofu comes in triangular form, deep fried to perfection with crispiness on the outside and sily smooth interior. These tofu was tossed in fragrant oats, curry leaves and chilli padi. Also one of their classic bestseller.Crispy Golden Oats ?????????? - $17A delicious mixture of vegetables that includes egg plant, long beans, lady's fingers and petai bean in Sambal Sauce. This is also one of the recommended dish by the restaurant.Penang Sambal King ???????? - $17Nutritionally prepared with wolfberry and angelica root \"dang gui\" herbs in perfect harmony of broccoli and monkey head mushroom. This species of mushroom contains health-enhancing properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and beneficial effects on brain -boosting functions.Enchanted Forest ????????? - $23The dish has a sensational texture and highly addictive in its tangy sauce as well as refreshing pineapple chunks. If I didn't know I am having vegetarian food, I might be fooled by its appearance and taste that it is the actual meat. A must try!Thai Sweet & Sour Delight ????????- $18Overall, the price maybe on the high side but it is still worth a visit if you want to enjoy some great taste of plant-based food. Definitely I will recommend Whole Earth if someone is looking for quality vegetarian food.","1138":"This has become a regular stop in my time in Singapore, and there are growing and very good vegetarian options. \u00a0The ambiance is casual with a moderne, bright design, good energy. \u00a0You cannot go wrong with any food choice and they are very creative with their versions of Singapore\/Asian dishes -- beautifully rendered in fresh, bright vegetables, tofu, Tempe and remarkable mushrooms. \u00a0Portions are healthy, but plenty of room to share and experiment.","1139":"The food is better than at some Peranakan protein restaurants. Penang rendang is scrumptious. Although I am a big fan of buah keluak, I find the version here too overwhelming, probably because it's too 'pure'. Friendly and helpful service staff.","1140":"Great dishes that were fresh, tasty and well prepared. A little high on the price points. Olive rice, rendang and the enchanted forest were shareable small-medium portions.","1141":"I'd never had Peranakan food before (ok, I'd never even heard the word \"Peranakan\" before coming to Singapore) so I was super-intrigued by this place, which bills itself as a Peranakan-Thai vegetarian restaurant.Whole Earth has a pretty interesting menu with plenty of exotic dishes to choose from. I had fun paging through it all, but I knew what I wanted the minute I saw it: crispy oatmeal tofu. It's listed as their \"classic bestseller,\" so I couldn't wait. I also ordered a side of rice.The dish was yum. The blend of spices and fragrances were amazing. The tofu was nice, and I'm picky about my tofu.My only real complaint was that the whole dish was super-dry. It's like, take a bunch of dry crunchy oat flakes and some dry tofu, throw some spices on them, and put them on a plate. No sauces whatsoever. While the spices were exquisite, the total dryness of the food was a bit strange. Even just a hint of sauce would've made it much nicer.If you're vegan, make sure to verify that your dish contains no dairy or egg or honey. (They do use dairy in some of their desserts and things.)The atmosphere here was a little sterile and corporate, and the price was a definitely on the high side for lunch, but it's pretty centrally located (not far from the Tanjong Pagar station), the food is interesting, and it's definitely worth a visit if you're curious to try some Peranakan vegetarian food.Note that they are currently closed until April 2017 for a renovation, and their menu might change too.","1142":"Vegetarian Peranakan-Thai food! Even if you're a carnivore, the flavors here won't disappoint.For three people, we ordered: Nonya Curry, Steamed Jade Wrap, Penang Rendang, Monkey Head Mushroom with Broccoli, and the Mango Tamarind Vegetarian Fish. They also offered some fried \"salmon\" skin (actually crispy seaweed bean curd skin) for S$2 to start off the meal. No complaints for any of the dishes...we devoured everything. For drinks, the we all got the hot yuzu tea since we were feeling a bit under the weather, and it was a nice complement to all the dishes.Everything was tasty, but since the portions were a bit small, we had to order quite a few dishes and the total bill came up to be on the pricey side (~S$40pp after GST and service charge). If you do have vegetarian constraints, would like to have more veggies in your diet, or would just like to try a different yet authentic preparation of classic dishes, then Whole Earth is a great choice.","1143":"What a disaster. Took my family of 14 for a meal here and was looking forward to it however it is one of the most disappointing restaurant I have been in the last 2 years. I will start by saying that all and yes all the food was probably prepared by using prepacked paste.The starter Ngoh hiang tasted like it was just bought off a supermarket shelf fried and given to us 2\/10 however the mushroom salad tasted good 7\/10.Even the drinks were somewhat amateurish I had the cinnamon ginger and sipped only a tiny bit. The passion fruit drink was again too sweet. What a waste 4\/10.The entrees were again so amateurish that we were flabbergasted how on Earth this restaurant is still running. The Rendang mutton was inedible in the sense that the soya\/gluten was too chewy ( usually due to being too long on shelf). The rending tasted good but could have been much better 5\/10. The Asam pedas was a total whacked job. It was but a thin soupy dish with egg plant dancing around the broth. It was so disgusting many of us had only one take. 1\/10. We were left perplexed as to how they came to serve such lousy fare.We also had Sambal egg plant again it was at best mediocre and was not as appetizing as it looked. 3\/10The next dish braised and fried mushroom was no better. Most took a piece and never had a second. 2\/10We also had brown\/red rice and everyone had a drink. For 14 we ordered 3 dishes of each.The total bill came to $680 including service charge.I must say the service was excellent 9\/10 however the food left a very bad aftertaste. All did not want to order any desserts so we went off to lau pasak for Chen dollars etc etc.I do not have a habit of putting a restaurant down as many make a living out of it however in this case I took exception. The food was horrendously prepared cheaply and tasteless was not on par as what should be served in any restaurant.","1144":"Whole Earth is a great option in Singapore if you are vegetarian or want to try vegetarian Peranakan food! We ordered the following:Nyonya Curry: The flavor of the curry was a bit too strong for my taste but it is still delicious!Steamed Tofu with Mince Paste: This was awesome, the mince paste is super flavorful and you can tell the tofu is freshTom Yam Fried Rice: The rice was aromatic and packed with flavor so I wouldn't recommend eating it with the curry since the latter would overpower the taste. Best to eat with something on the lighter side (like the tofu or scallops).Calamansi Juice: The juice wasn't that fresh as it was still a tad bitter but overall was fine.Steamed Jade Wrap: This was delicious! The filling and wrap had balanced flavors. The sauce stood out the most in this dish though.Mushroom \"Scallops\": This was my favorite of the dishes we ordered. The mushrooms were juicy and well-cooked. The texture of these mushrooms is amazing. Service is quick and attentive. While you do have to pay for water (S$0.30\/person), I didn't really have any other concerns. Next time I'm in Singapore, I will definitely pay a visit to Whole Earth (and get the scallops again)!","1145":"Another Singapore visit.Another Vegetarian restaurant.This is what happens when the friend you're visiting is also a vegetarian. ;) Oh, happy days! :DI've never been to a Vegetarian Thai restaurant, so was intrigued and curious how the dishes would be.Whole Earth is definitely on the pricier side. For what we got at Whole Earth, we could have gotten a lot more at 8 Treasures Vegetarian. Plus, Jinny and I definitely prefer the food at 8 Treasures Vegetarian more, but this was certainly a good experience to try out a different vegetarian restaurant. I love trying out different veg restaurants so that I can compare one to another and know what I prefer, etc. One thing I didn't like about this place was that they charge for water. Not bottled water, but just hot water. I thought that was extremely odd. I turned it down since I've never had to pay for hot water in my life at any restaurant I've ever been to, the fact that they charge for water just screams \"cheap\" to me.","1146":"First time here. Very authentic taste - \u00a0Penang Rendang, Yam Treasure Ring, especially the Samba King. I wish they have a store in the US. Portion is a bit small and slightly over priced for vegetarian foods. Nice ambient setting.... good services.h*","1147":"You know, I really want to like this place 100%, but with other vegetarian and even organic restaurants in Singapore that sell at a much cheaper price point, it's hard to go all the way and give it 5 stars. But with that, this place offers super tasty vegetarian meals, with faux meat dishes made of mushrooms. I've tried both their lemongrass tea and their floral tea. Both are wonderful and already sweetened, but not too sweet. I've had their Tom yum soup, rand dang, olive rice and sweet & sour chicken. All wonderful! The portions are also just right, for me at least. I wouldn't say great for sharing since it may or may not be enough, depending on how many people are with you or how big your bellies are. Considering I can eat quite large portions all to myself, I usually order 2 dishes and I still end up with take away. Take that as you will!Expect to pay around $30 per person for 1 specialty drink, 1-2 main dishes and a rice dish. Worth it? Yea, if you're willing to spend more for an occasional treat of vegetarian food.","1148":"I think this is currently my favorite vegetarian spot. Their dishes make you think if meat is over-rated, (Ok, I lied, I can't do without my sashimi) but this is as close as it gets.We had the set menu which has most of their signature dishes. The memorable one is definitely the rendang and the oatmeal tofu.The rendang is made with mushrooms. The gravy is so rich and fragrant that you really do not miss the meat. The mushrooms used also has a great meaty texture and this is a perfect vegetarian rendang.The oatmeal tofu is a rendition of oatmeal prawns vegetarian style. Oatmeal is sweet and nicely crisped, and not oily. Brilliant deep frying.Price point, it is not cheap but not restaurant expensive like LingZhi. It's closer to bistro\/cafe pricing. For delicious veggies, this will be my choice.","1149":"Yay! An affiliate of Naive (I'm a big fan!) which is more accessible (for a westie, anyway.) I'd been eating rather unhealthily (i.e. vege-lacking) and so wanted some vegetarian food.. Whole Earth to the rescue!They offered us pickled papaya\/seaweed chips for appetizers, decided to try the latter. Pretty nice beancurd skin crisps wrapped around seaweed!Delicious braised monkeyhead mushrooms with broccoli, with some woflberries thrown in for good measure. $19 is a little steep, but I guess for the occasional treat, yum! As the bf pointed out, mushrooms were done very well! He also has had the oatmeal tofu at some other point and said it was really good, didn't miss meat at all :)Thai mango and tamarind mango fish ($18) was also yummy, liked the sauce a lot! The 'fish' was more like five round slices of patties. Texture and taste were like a water chestnut\/lotus root mix, not sure where the tofu came in really. The skin forming the circumference of the patty recalled the seaweed chip appetizer. Somewhat carby, actually, so was quite content to eat it without rice.The bf ordered brown rice (as opposed to white, said it wouldn't feel right ordering white rice at such a healthy place haha).","1150":"Had the Penang Redang, the Sambal King and the Fried Hong Kong Noodles to share...Washed it down with the fresh lemongrass drink.Everything here was fabulous... especially the spicy Sambal King dish... really enjoyed it - great lunch spot...","1151":"Delicious Thai-Peranakan vegatarian food.Came here for lunch at about 1pm and it seemed like the crowd has already dispersed a little. I think if you're planning to come here earlier, it might be a good idea to make a reservation first just in case.Individual prices are a little pricey for lunch so we stuck to Tom Yum soup and 5-spice nyoh hiang to share. Then we each had Olive Brown Rice and Kampong Fried Rice. I'm personally particularly about my carb intake so seeing brown rice on the menu really did it for me.We were still looking through the menu when a waitress came up to us to inform us \u00a0that a group of 6 had just arrived and we should try to place our orders now to avoid a long wait. That was pretty nice of them really. So we placed our orders and not long after, our food arrived.The Tom Yum soup was delicious, though not as spicy as I like it. It's a pretty big bowl so there was more than enough for me and my friend to share. Next the nyoh hiang. SO GOOD! The sweet sauce that come with this complimented this perfectly. The pieces are smaller than they appear in the picture on the menu though but again, there was more than enough for both of to share.My Olive Brown Rice was really good I must say. I love olives in general so I didn't think they could go wrong on this with me. I was a bit surprised that it didn't have cashews though, but maybe it's only because my previous experiences with Olive Fried Rice always had cashews. Haha. Overall, I really enjoyed this dish! \u00a0Unfortunately though, the same can't be said for the Kampong Fried Rice. My friend complained that it was pretty mediocre, and after trying it for myself, I have to admit that it was the blandest dish among the others that we'd already ordered.Would definitely return here but probably only with a group of friends to share dishes with.","1152":"Well known amongst Singaporean's vegetarian community, Whole Earth's remarkable food goes beyond the borders and appeals to many carnivorous friends as well. Nestled in a cosy but spacious corner in the heart of Tanjong Pagar, Whole Earth offers a range of Peranakan and Thai cuisine, from the highly recommended Penang Rendang ($18) to a mean Tom Yum soup ($9).Any true Peranakan place has a good serving of Buah Keluak, and Whole Earth is no different; its rendition of Nutty Buah Keluak ($18) will leave vegetarians satisfied with the unmistakeable taste of the dish, minus the meat. True to it's equally expensive but morally questionable roots, a bowl of Sharks Fin broth goes at $18; if you're looking for something soupy to go with your meal, however, the Homemade Assam Pedas ($18) is available at the same price but with far more flavour. Whole Earth's rice and noodles dishes are far less impressive, so it would be a wise choice to opt for more dishes to share while going easy on the mains. These steep prices do not deter the crowds, and it is best to make a reservation with Whole Earth if you intend to explore the scrumptious Peranakan-Thai cuisine, entirely vegetarian and almost addictive. You'll certainly be back for more, but, because of its prices, Whole Earth is more of a once-a-month treat than it is a regular place you can dine at.","1153":"When I go to a vegetarian restaurant, you know what I want to eat? Vegetables. \u00a0Go figure. \u00a0So it always bothers me when they make the vegetarian dishes all about meat substitutes. \u00a0As a person that still eats meat I have no desire for dressed up tofu products. \u00a0Sure, I enjoy tofu as much as the next person but I am way more into okra and potatoes. \u00a0Getting that off my chest helps. \u00a0This place does have style going for it. \u00a0I loved the atmosphere of the old building and the modern furnishings. \u00a0My table snacks were very promising. That papaya pickle was amazing. \u00a0I guess I just ordere the wrong thing after that. \u00a0The sour curry was too tofu heavy. \u00a0I felt less than stellar about the pumpkin sticky rice dessert especially since it seemed they didn't know the difference between sticky rice and sago. \u00a0I might go back and try the more thai dishes but probably not.","1154":"Food was alright. Don't get confused, you're not going to find westernized Thai food (Pad Thai, etc) here. As real vegetarians they tried to make it taste too much like meat. There has to be a better Thai restaurant in Singapore.","1155":"They have really good vegan food. \u00a0Not great, but really good. \u00a0They are right by a train stop (which makes it easy to get to) and they also take visa (which is big plus in Singapore).","1156":"My go-to place for vegetarian Thai-Peranakan food.If you think that's an oxymoron, as I once used to, you really should try it here.Without dialling down on the spices and the cooking, Whole Earth manages to make the dishes we love so much without meat, and without the blanket replacement of every meat with a substitute mock meat. Mushrooms and beancurd are used cleverly. I don't even miss the meat, honestly! The nyonya curry with mushrooms, kong bah, assam pedas, rendang and olive rice are my faves. So is the vegetarian yam ring pot. They also have lots of herbal soups!","1157":"Place is spacious and comfortable for small or large groups. First time trying this place out and it has not disappoint yet. Am not really a vegetarian girl and not converting any time soon but once in a while to find a vegetarian restaurant that does not serve oily food is a plus. Price is a lil pricey but I guess anything 'healthy' nowadays are.","1158":"One of my favorite places in Singapore! Absolutely delicious dishes: Petai, Tofu w\/ crispy oats, Monkey head mushroom and awesome Yuzu tea.","1159":"Who says vegetarian can't be tasty? World earth prove that wrong!! They serve Peranakan Thai style. Definitely will revisit again.","1160":"The food was good - decent - but it was sort of pricey compared to other vegetarian restaurants I've been to in Singapore. While the flavor was good, portions were really small and again - over priced.","1161":"wow rocket, how you have grown!(??????come october you will be 10 years old and i think it's time i chipped in with this review.your transformation is now complete after getting a much deserved, gorgeous facelift last year.i really like how you have matured, like a good wine.from willin's days as a lawyer home chef for hire, to him taking that plunge to ditch the legal fraternity with only a passion for the chef apprentice's apron and then learning the way of the \u00a0kitchen on the job before striking out with a modern singaporean creativity as inspiration.his gregarious personality and boundless creativity made him a hit from the start, albeit not with me.don't get me wrong, his food was good but in his early days i felt it lacked that polished finish which always led me to think i can also do that leh.nonetheless, he became a cult figure almost instantly.i thought he was but a pricey fad but boy has history proven me wrong.i think willin and his team kept on learning, innovating and did not stay put in their comfort food zone.sure people still ask for that laksa pesto dish and i'm sure he will still whip one up for you, but his repertoire has grown many folds.there is also now a sophistication much like how your pony tailed girl will one day be adorned with foundation, blusher, mascara and lipstick.and of course, it's beyond just mere cosmetic changes.the blossoming comes from within, how she carries herself oozing with confidence, speaking with maturity and a dad-i'm-not-a-little-girl-anymore look!that is when you know, for sure, she has arrived.and all of that shows through his current omakase offerings.every dish left me eagerly anticipating the next and lifted, slowly but surely, the ratings to a solid five!willin has been a celebrity chef for years now.he does not need any affirmation, least so from me.but after a delectable dining experience here last night, i knew i had to finally put in my two cents worth.yes, i got out of bed at 4.45am just to penned this.yes, i think wild rocket will wow you too!","1162":"One of the best meals I had in Singapore. I'm not a huge fan of fusion food but felt that they created a good mix here. The char siu and rice burger stood out along w the modern take on pomelo salad. Also had a great sake selection. Worth a go.","1163":"A perfect dining experience. Simply perfect. The Omakase Menu is both visually stunning as well as delicious. \u00a0The service is as perfect as one can imagine. Every detail is anticipated. [Chef] Willin spent the later part of the evening with us discussing food and wine. What an amazing and talented person. His great sense of humor and keen interest in in the experience he and team provides was a memorable conclusion to the evening. Enough can not be said about how wonderful this Mount Emily restaurant. The entire experience rean well into the night and morning and plan to return again for our 5 + hour experience with our new friends at Wild Rocket.","1164":"Hate giving this low of a review to any place but this is one of the few times I've walked out of a restaurant quite disappointed by the awful flavors of every dish we received. Everything is subjective and all restaurants have bad days which is fine but I just can't justify going back to a place like this after the experience we had.The restaurant is out of the way inside of a budget hotel\/hostel. After walking inside the hotel\/hostel doors, you can make your way through the Wild Rocket entrance and into the small and intimate (and awesomely decorated) interior. Really good music playing too, we were pumped.My girlfriend and I came in for a later weekday evening dinner and ordered a la carte since none of the mains looked appealing in the four course menu (and the omakase wasn't available unless you book in advance since the head chef needs to be present to serve it).We ordered the following:1) Pomelo Salad with tiger prawns and frozen coconut dressing - Easy starter but the frozen coconut dressing (I think the waitress might have said blue cheese as well) was a bit too heavy. It was the only item that we did finish though.2) Salmon Belly Red Rice and Baby Octopus donburi - The red rice, although oily, was worth eating but the fish wasn't. It had a very fishy flavor like it wasn't cooked all the way.3) Laksa pesto linguini with king prawn - Who can resist a linguini dish that is made with \"Laksa Pesto\"?? We were told that so many customers loved this dish so much that they constantly requested that the chef put it back on his menu. Unfortunately for both of us, the pasta tasted awful. It tasted like an overly peppered and dry pasta dish. Both myself and my girlfriend (born and raised Singaporean) couldn't even taste the slightest bit of laksa in the pasta. The king prawn was fantastic however. We ate that and left the entire pasta.4) Thai Basil Minced Pork Bee Tai Mak with Onsen egg - Just awful. The meat tasted like cheap ground beef that you can find in a fast food restaurant. Nothing here tasted good, we both took a bite and left the entire dish. 5) Teh Tarik panna cotta with pearls - It was a good effort but I wish they did something else instead of panna cotta. The pearls are identical to those you would find in a bubble tea (they give you four pearls) and the teh tarik tastes extremely sweet. I feel this was too easy a dessert to make without much creativity.6) Pineapple dark chocolate tart - This is pretty much what you can expect a pineapple dark chocolate tart to taste like. Nothing special at all.For a restaurant that has been around as long as this one and for the amount of patrons that have been here, I really would have thought there would have been more to it. If you want a real \"Modern\" Singaporean meal, I would highly suggest you visit Labyrinth instead.","1165":"DATE\/TIME: November 18, 2011 \/ 1:00pmAMBIANCE: Clean modern interior with lots of natural light.

He is very friendly and open minted. Had a nice chat and the menu he served was delicious! Will be back next time I'm visiting Singapore!","1167":"This is a review of a Thursday evening dinner date at Wild Rocket.The restaurant is located in the Hangout at Mount Emily. \u00a0Even though it is not, it has the feel of being in a secluded area.i quite liked the ambiance of the restaurant. \u00a0It had the feel of casual fine dining. \u00a0I thought it was a very comfortable room. \u00a0The wall with many candles added a warmth to the room. \u00a0 My dinner companion \u00a0was less taken with \u00a0the space.tinyurl.com\/bs5os3xThe service was very good. \u00a0Our server was attentive, professional, and polite. \u00a0He was also quite knowledgeable about the menu and proactively provided input without being intrusive. The \u00a0food ranged from good with some technical errors to extremely good. \u00a0Each dish was presented with a clean and classic style. \u00a0While simple, the presentation was elegant.Complimentary Bread - The meal began with a nice warm focaccia bread served with olive oil and salt. \u00a0When we had finished the first plate, they were quick to ask and bring another \u00a0plate.tinyurl.com\/ca529xtSoft shell chili crab with squid ink mantou - This was a tasty appetizer sized interpretation of the classic chili crab.tinyurl.com\/cogpfrcBeef Carpaccio with sesame ginger puree - For me, this was a home-run. \u00a0The dish came with the ginger puree in the middle. \u00a0Our server explained that \u00a0the puree should be spread out across the carpaccio. \u00a0This was slightly easier said than done. \u00a0But, once I had achieved getting it spread around, it was so good. \u00a0The spread added such a refreshing element to the simple application of beef carpaccio.tinyurl.com\/d5b5t9rLaksa Pesto Linguini - My friend ordered the laksa pasta. \u00a0The flavour was quite nice. \u00a0It was a very assertive flavour but I liked it and she seemed to also. \u00a0The server had also provided input that the dish was strongly flavoured. \u00a0However, the dish (specifically the pasta) was very dry and this definitely detracted from this entree.tinyurl.com\/ck2nk4zRoasted Chilean Seabass with chai poh confit & congee - The fish was perfectly prepared. \u00a0It was delicate and flaky. \u00a0However, I would have preferred that it was served with something \u00a0that would provide a balance to the overall flavours. \u00a0The congee did not seem to compliment the seabass. \u00a0It competed and came close to overpowering the simple natural flavour of the fish.tinyurl.com\/cnbtceuCrab Meat Whipped Potatoes - She ordered a side of crab-meat mashed potatoes. \u00a0For each of us, this was a new preparation. \u00a0In the end, I found it to be good but it didn't really standout from other whipped potatoes and the crab may have actually interfered with creating the best possible texture for the potatoes.tinyurl.com\/c9geazkDark Lava Chocolate Gateau with flamb\u00e9 banana - For dessert, she ordered the chocolate lava cake. \u00a0This was pretty much a standard implementation of this dish that has recently become a staple. It was good but there wasn't anything to set it apart from other versions of the \u00a0same dish. \u00a0On the other-hand, you really can't go wrong with a cake filled with delicious melted chocolate.tinyurl.com\/bn5nzjxWild Rocket Strawberry Cheesecake - \u00a0Maybe it is becoming a clich\u00e9 to serve food in a martini glass. \u00a0But this was still a visually interesting and appealing dessert. \u00a0Following the server's instructions, I cut my spoon down and into the dessert insuring to get a little bit of everything. \u00a0I have to say, it was divine. \u00a0It was a great dessert incorporating multiple levels of sharp flavours, sweet flavours, and varying textures.tinyurl.com\/cwexnmsReceipt ($292.40):tinyurl.com\/bt9bz9cOverall - I thought Wild Rocket combined excellent service, a comfortable and slightly elegant space with relatively good food that included some true high-points. \u00a0From a culinary perspective, the execution was not perfect but did not greatly affect the \u00a0overall enjoyment of the meal. \u00a0I would definitely consider returning to Wild Rocket.","1168":"Such a lovely cosy space. Warm wood and soft lighting, very inviting though the air con was set far too low. Great sake selection and reasonably priced wine list (yes, I mean, for Singapore). The menu reads so well and the staff were informed and able to describe and discuss dishes. The food I'm about 50\/50. My girlfriend was worried she would have order envy but it turned out the other way around. Her red rice salmon and baby octopus starter was delicate, rich and delicious. My shitake consomme was deep, dark and earthy but the wonton itself was a let down. The wrapper was chewy and the filling bland. Her pasta was perfectly al dente in a deliciously dark sticky sauce. My chilli spanner crab linguini was so drenched in a quite sweet and not very chilli sauce that I didn't notice the pasta. Service was friendly and attentive.","1169":"I headed down to this place quite a while ago and am very sure the menu has been revamped since then but I'm quite sure the tastes and quality will still be relevant now.I've heard a lot about the place prior to going to Wild Rocket, especially so from my friend who convinced me to make the trip down because she was so impressed by the food from an earlier visit. Situated within Mount Emily, it was a comfortable setting to have a nice weekend lunch amidst the greenery surrounding the small boutique hotel it is located at.Being a fan of brown rice, I naturally veered towards the Salmon Carpaccio Brown Rice for my starter. For those who love asiatic flavours, you'll fall in love with this dish - the melt-in-your-mouth salmon coupled with the nutty aromatic brown rice and sesame seeds, mixed with chewy bits of octopus meat. This was an amazing mix of textures and flavours which makes you well and truly appreciate the beauty of well-prepared food.I also had the Chilean Seabass with Chai Poh confit. I loved the flakiness of the plush fish meat which was done plain to accompany to richer topping. The chai poh was not overpowering salty like how typical ones can be, showing how properly done food doesn't need too much seasoning to work. All these was served on a bed of plain congee which was a throwback to childhood food and really comforting to have.I rounded off my meal with something richer, the Strawberry Cheesecake. More like a deconstructed version of the cake, you get a creamy strawberry cheese icecream with a thick body layered with chunky bits of graham base.","1170":"Getting to Wild Rocket is always an adventure - walking to the Grand Cathay and then climbing the 56 (if I'm not mistaken) steps to the top of Mount Emily, before tip-toeing down... The restaurant is nicely decorated and set in a dim, candle-lit space, and the waiters carry a chalkboard over when you sit to enthusiastically explain their special menu for the day, and the house wines... it's fun!Then the food comes - it's pricy (expect a main to be about $20-50 dollars), and tastes a little above average - the Pizza with Prosciutto and Rocket was pretty good, and the half Rosemary Chicken was just enough for one. Coming here is always fun, though the food isn't much to remark about!","1171":"You know, I visited Wild Rocket back when it was relatively fresh and a super 'hot table'. I wasn't impressed, and never went back.So when a friend said that dinner was at Wild Rocket, I was unenthused, and actually a little wary. Wild Rocket team, I apologise. You've gotten better. First off, the service was outstanding. I asked the waiter attending to our table if the once signature laksa pesto pasta was still available despite being not on the menu, and he was very candid in telling us that it's a love it or hate it dish. When we ended up passing, he brought out a \u00a0moderate sized portion anyway \"just for us to try\" (and of course didn't charge us for it). He was able to give recommendations easily, and most importantly, honestly! He told us to avoid certain dishes, and everything that he recommended was spot on.Well. We ignored him when it came to dessert and were glad we did, but more on that later.I confess to forgetting exactly what we had for starters and mains, but I do remember all of us being quite impressed, particularly with the mains. I believe my friend had the pork, and it was particularly memorable. The one let down that evening was the pasta main (not the pesto) that our other dining companion ordered. It was a bit flat, and really quite unspectacular. Desserts though, were an absolute treat. We had... hmm. A chendol I think? Of some sort, with delicious gula melaka, a ice jelly type thing, and a deconstructed apple pie I believe. Our waiter had actually recommended the molten chocolate cake over the ice jelly, but we were glad we ignored him. The other desserts were rich enough, and the ice jelly with lime granita... or was it a lemon sorbet, well with sour frozen thing proved to be an excellent contrast. We mainly ignored it though because really, once you've had a good molten chocolate cake, you've probably seen them all.So yes, I'm glad I went back to re-experience Wild Rocket. The food was creative, really quite delicious, and the service warm and accommodating. That's a winning combination.","1172":"One of my fave restaurants in Singapore; partly because it's located on Mt Sophia (fond memories of high school at MGS) but mostly because it's so quiet and serene up in the exclusive and secluded neighborhood. Love the laksa pasta, their take on black pepper soft shell crab and everything they have on the brunch menu. If you're looking for a leisurely, quiet, no-fuss, no drama meal, Wild Rocket is the way to go","1173":"An interesting menu, truly fusion in nature. Local flavours applied to French style cuisine done with creativity. I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed the unique menu. Never a dull experience. The location is a bit hard to get to but worth the taxi ride or drive to Upper Willie Road.","1174":"Ah yes. The hype and the review. Is it as good as it sounds? Let's find out :) My first time coming here and I was already hooked up for my second time and so on in the future. It is actually a very straightforward menu that anyone could have made and I believe you can find similar menu of wet bakchor mee anywhere in every corner of Singapore. And how different and stand out you will find this stall is compared to others. This stall only serves 1 menu and 1 menu only: wet bakchor mee. First time is not dinner nor lunch time so it was only 10 minutes wait. Second visit was late dinner time at around 10 pm and we got to wait for 1 hour for our orders to come. And anytime, I would wait without complaints at all :) the texture of the noodles is perfect, with the right consistency and flavor that seeps into the noodles (I always appreciate flavorful noodles be it bakchor mee or ramen, that comes not from the soup or condiments but the noodles itself). The soup is very flavorful with its hints of fresh sauteed garlic. The minced pork is very very good since it is cooked in perfection, in boiled soup itself. The porkballs are a perfection with its tenderness and juiciness. Basically it is a bowl of heaven I am eating and I have not had any better bakchor mee than this in entire singapore (I am open for suggestions, but for now, this is the best, hands down). So if you have the time, you should eat here. If you don't have the time, come before or after rush hours and you will be delighted and come back.","1175":"It's the place you go for wet bak chor mee! Everyone else does it dry but this place has the power and authority to make it wet! It's the simple things that are the hardest to make, and honestly there are not many places that can compete with this kind of focus (only wet!) and quality. Let's start with the noodles. Noodle is springy yet not overly springy. There is a good bite-feel. Even if you do takeaways, don't worry that the noodle will become fat and soggy, the stall keeper will pack it separate with the soup. Thoughtful service. The soup is just so nice and you don't get tired of it. It's concocted in a traditional way of simply making good broth! It blends so well and so in-separately with the minced meat that were cooked with it. Meat balls are chewy and good, just tuck it in your mouth and I shouldn't have to review its meat balls to you!The last part is the chili. The part I never really cared about as I used to always eat it without the chili. But with just one time trying with the noodle, soup and chili, I feel in love with a brand new taste and a new world of this simple dish but yet so rare to find.","1176":"If i have a Bak Chor Mee craving, this is where i would go to satisfy it. The noodles are different from the dry meepok version with pig's liver and minced meat. This is meat ball soup noodles at its most basic with only meat balls, minced meat and springy thin noodles. The minced meat is very different. It has a soft cottony texture that is slightly powdery. It simply disintegrates as you slurp it with your noodles. Definitely not the chewy minced pork at most stalls. The soup is a clear, savory pork broth which is simple but very comforting. There are several bak chor mee stalls at Bedok 85 Feng Shan Hawker centre but this is the one that you should be eating at. $2.50 for a small bowl which is alright if you have a small appetite or if you are ordering other dishes to share. A tip is to have this later at night when the soup has already absorbed the essence of the meat. Perfect supper dish.","1177":"these two stalls of minced pork soup noodles (Xing Ji and Seng Hiang) are so similar and are even lined up next to each other.This is not the usual dry-tossed minced pork noodles in many other places, but a soup noodles that has only minced pork and pork balls. What I like most about this noodle is the chewy thin noodles, in a strong rich pork broth.We did a side by side taste test and it is very close. I have a slight preference (very slight really) for Seng Hiang's broth as it seems to be more fragrant due to the stronger garlic taste. But I will happily eat fro either stall.They send over the noodles, so you do not need to wait in line. Grab a table, place your order, and go order some yummy bbq chicken wings while you wait.","1178":"Mention Blk 85 Bak Chor Mee and almost anyone will relate to that. Such is the stature of this iconic, yet, simple dish. It's a no frills dish with a simple line up of springy egg noodles, clear soup, meat balls, minced pork, crispy fried onions and sliced chilli.So what makes this dish so special? It really is the simplicity of it all. The wonderful balance of noodles with the soup that flavoured by the minced pork and fried onions, laced with hints of heat from the chilli. \u00a0It's the essence of Singapore hawker fare at its best.","1179":"Oh delicious delicious!!! Let me state upfront that I'm normally a fan of dry style bak chor mee. However I'd make an exception in this case because this is so yummy! It's all in the soup. When I first tasted it, I wasn't immediately sold but as you continue eating, it really draws you in with its tastiness. Definitely worth a try.","1180":"They say this is the best bak chor mee stall at Block 85. Well I've tried a couple and i can't honestly tell the difference. But that being said this stall is pretty darn good. Totally love the soup base with lots of minced meat. Only problem is that you'll have to wait for quite a while especially around dinner time. Minimum of 30 mins, I reckon!","1181":"Dinner at Yan Ting St. Regis Hotel, Singapore28 April 2017Celebrated my aunt's 80th birthdaySpecial set menu of Alaskan Crab.Changed the perch for Peking duck.Good meal.The crispy yam roll was good and I don't even like yam.Soup was good and the piece of breast chicken meat was surprisingly tender.The flat green vermicelli was more like a glass kway teow but there was hardly any Alaskan crab roe - very nice.Dessert - jelly was so so but the custard pastry was soooooo gooooood.","1182":"Not only were all of the food delicious, it was also very well executed and presented. We ordered a duck dish where the duck skin were rolled in a wrap (much like a mushu wrap dish). This was a great combination of a well balaned savory dish with contrasting textures. You have a choice of how your duck meat gets cooked (unlike traditional Peking duck where you wrap the meat in a bun). We opted for a lettuce stir fry and it was by far the best duck dish I've had! We also ordered a vegetable dish and you could tell how fresh the vegetable was and it was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the service was exceptional where our servers were very attentive and accommodating.","1183":"Came here on a Sunday morning for the brunch buffet - who says no to free flow dimsum? Damage was 98++ per person.Started off with the complimentary abalone soup and lobster steamed with egg white. Abalone wasn't chewy, so that was good. The lobster was unfortunately very plain, I had to drizzle soy sauce over it for taste.We ordered a bunch of items - egg tarts, custard buns, fried scallops in XO sauce, chicken feet; the standard dim sum items with a few dishes thrown in. The quality of the dimsum there is generally good, you won't go wrong here. For what it's worth, my friend loved the sweet and sour pork here, and polished off two plates of it. Though I have no idea why anyone would order that for dimsum...","1184":"For more reviews and full reviews, visit my blog!There's nothing like pampering oneself at a luxury hotel. Every whims and fancy would have been thought of and catered to so that one could go into vegetation and relax comfortably. The St. Regis provides all that customized service and attention with panache, as evidenced by accolades heaped on by many renowned publications around the world. The same standards apply to the restaurants as well and i was fortunate to experience what fine Cantonese dining means at the award winning Yan Ting. We had a special 7 course set designed to give us a preview of the 10 CNY set menus that Yan Ting has this Snake year. Think of this as a best of dishes list. Yu Sheng is a must have dish for CNY. Every component has its own significance and mostly related to wealth and luck. Yan Ting has switched the radish for snow pear to give the dish its subtle sweetness. I like that the sauce is lot less sweet than the usual Yu Sheng because pomelo juice is added. Abalone and Salmon are also included in this dish.Pun Choy is a classic CNY dish. This casserole pot dish came about when villagers offered the best ingredient they have in their home for sharing during the festive season in the old days. All the contributed ingredients would then be placed, layer upon layer, with the blandest ingredient (typically the vegetables) at the bottom and the meat on top. The end result would be a rich and flavorful stew that is delicious and satisfying.Yan Ting's Pun Choy is the luxe version with abalone, dried scallops, dace fish, pork belly, fish maw, prawns, roasted duck and soya sauce chicken, layered on a bed of white radish and cabbage. This is no doubt one of my favorite dishes of the night. You could also take this away for reunion dinner at home. Each takeaway order receives a complimentary Salmon \"Yu Sheng\" with Fish Roe, and Fried Glutinous Rice with Preserved Meat, all stellar dishes. This is a great leftover dish because the flavors are more intense overnight and the ingredients more tender. Definitely my favorite leftover CNY dish. :)The Steamed Sea Perch Fillet with Special Coral Sauce is minimally flavored to allow diners a clear taste of this premium ingredient. It's so premium that only top Chinese restaurants serve this fish. This deep sea fish is more expensive than cod fish and richer in omega 3 content. Definitely not something that you can get at the supermarket. The taste and texture of the sea perch is very delicate and doesn't taste as oily and heavy as cod. This is great for health conscious folks. More dishes in btn...Till that point in the dinner, I had been sampling all the dishes in an effort not to overeat. But when the Wok Fried Glutinous rice with Wind Dried Sausages was served, i finished every single grain. The dish is very simple but it tastes like home, very heart (and tummy) warming. I guess i tasted the effort Chef put into bringing in the special wind dried Chinese sausages from Hong Kong.The Set Lunch and Dinner Menus are priced $98 to $328++ per pax, with a minimum of 2 guests. There is also an 8 course Vegetarian set menu at $108++ per pax. Other than set menus, there is also a special \u00e1 la carte menu and some dishes are also available for takeaway from now till 24th Feb 201","1185":"This is probably the worst dim sum I have had in a long... long time. \u00a0The food is not well prepared and the ingredients does not taste fresh. \u00a0And with the price they are charging, absolutely not worth it!","1186":"I used to love Yan Ting and was a big fan when they first opened years ago. However, since then, it seems the standards have deteriorated and the dim sum has become pretty inconsistent... Based on my last visit there (last week), none of the dim sum was impressive at all. We got the... Har Kau, Steamed Vegetable Dumpling, Salted Egg Custard Pau, Char Siew Pastry, Spinach w 3 kinds egg (not on the menu but they can do it upon request), Chicken Feet, Deep Fried Eggplant w Pork Floss, Roasted Duck and the Siu Yuk (Roasted Pork Belly).The only thing that really stood out, out of all the dishes was the Siu Yuk, which they do very well (the skin perfectly roasted and crisp and the meat incredibly tender). But that was about the only good dish we had there, everything else was simply mediocre at best. Except for the Char Siew Pastry, which is usually my favorite but tasted bad this round - strangely enough, it actually tasted dough-y. On the bright side, I love the St Regis and the ambience of the restaurant is classy and upscale, obviously very gorgeously decorated. But with so much good dim sum in Singapore, I'm not sure how Yan Ting is going to stay in business (especially since they're priced so high - approx $5 for 3pcs of dim sum).In terms of hotel dim sum restaurants, I'd pick Hua Ting at Orchard Hotel over this.2 - 2.5 stars, mainly because I've experienced much better.","1187":"Consistently excellent food at Yan Ting. We have been twice for champagne brunch and loved it. Here is my link for the full review, I need to update the blog with the second visit and new items. mylifeinsin.com\/2013\/04\/\u0085It isn't cheap, I must say, but you get over 3 hours of dim sum and other Cantonese food, and champagne of course, very important! I really liked the cute dumplings with three areas, one with mushrooms, one with carrots and one with celery I think. The soy sauce chicken is really really good, tender and flavourful. Crispy bean curd skin was great too. As well as the mushrooms and veggies. And my all time favourite was an utter revelation, vegetarian olive fried rice..... yummmmm! Sesame coated chocolate was also lovely. Check out my blog for more info and more reviews :)","1188":"In Singapore, not lacking in dim sum joint, can be seen in almost all Chinese restaurants, the only pain is the ability to single out the best during the seemingly simple pick & choose process. Here, Yan Ting has quite a few exceptionally good dim sum but some mediocre micro dishes; unlimited orders when you opt for a buffet-style. Instead of seeing a table-spread, this a la carte fashion allows you to order freely from the menu list - the a la minute way. Without repeating the dishes I have tired previously (the chef at work remains unchanged), I returned to savour 85% new ones, picked from 95 items, all vying for my attention!The orchestra start-off with ONE serving of Doubled-boiled Abalone Soup with Chicken (Braised Shark's Fin with Crab Roe previously - I guess you know why), full-bodied with clear seafood aroma but way too acrid for my likings. Rather, I preferred that Doubled-boiled Bamboo Pith Consomm\u00e9 with Shiitake Mushroom and Morel (bottom featured) - unclouded & subtle, \u00a0light broth with high quality fungi, very pleasant.Then you proceed to reward yourself with a portion of Lobster, the most celebrated chronicle was the Gratinated Cheese & Bacon - a sophisticated version baked using cheese that was smooth and rich and turned even more flavourful with the added bacon bits. The other Wok-baked in Superior broth & Spring Onion was paler but suits someone with a light palate.Highlighting the dim sum - Yan Ting seriously has the best BBQ Pork Char Siew Pastry in town. Consistent in taste except the changed in shape, the generous char siew fillings hit the spot every time. Others commented on the stingy stuffings and it makes me wonder if they desire a pail of it as I could see them almost piercing through the thin flaky pastry skin! The same in the past, never reduced in portion. I keep pictures of it if you wish proof lol. Less of any awful porky stench, the barbecue sauce coating the meat was gooey and sweet, together with the rich and melty pastry skin, I screamed for a second helping! They taste better than Shang Palace's, I confessed. But the latter has got a better Steamed BBQ Pork Bun \"Char Siew Bao\". Though both have a pillowy bun - soft and not palate sticking, Yan Ting's pork fillings lacked robustness and I'd prefer a dark chocolatey-hue, full of caramelised flavour from Shang Palace. Yan Ting's version wasn't that bad, it's just a personal choice.I didn't expect to reach anticlimax this soon, if you asked - skip the Stir-fried \"Cheong Fun\" Rice Rolls with XO Sauce. It sounds painful but the chef has declared the annulment of their marriage. The exceptionally good XO sauce has gone to waste when it failed to permeate the rice rolls, merely coating them - tasteless with a missing soul. Feedback delivered.My chemistry with rest of the dim sum was forceful if not weak. The weaker ones are the ovoid Deep Fried Yam Croquettes with Diced Chicken comes with a shattery outermost yam mash that envelopes some dull chicken mass - barely seasoned with a flat taste. The Har Kao & steamed Siew Mai have always been fresh and dewy in their constitution especially one nibble at the succulent shrimps in the pleated piece that offers a smooth and silky skin though I have never liked a Har Kao. Adequately seasoned, the thin yellow wrappers stuffed with fleshy minced pork\/prawn mixture are topping themselves with crab roe, these Siew Mai make strong opponents.When the appetiser comes into picture, I have made a clear identification that the Soy Sauce Chicken topped my list. Images of plumpish chicken poaching in light soy sauce that perfumed the pot, excites me with immediate urge to bite into that tender, smooth bird fragments. Every bite comforts me with a lingering cinnamon, star anise cologne and tamed my excitement with a gentle rock sugar sweetness. The rest of the meat selections lost the race. Lacking the familiarity, the Roasted Duck requires that needing crisp in the skin but the meat is less fibrous -good. The pork has a louder taste in its meat; but the roasted version fared slightly better than its barbecued cousins, for its ultra crunchy blistered skin but too salty. If you want something to nibble on, the Deep-fried Whitebait makes good choice, while the pulpy Marinated Jellyfish lends a good chew with a strong scallion oil scent. Less impressive, the Beef Shank with Soy Sauce, not astonishingly tender and I thought the chicken & soy sauce still make a perfect couple.I had a deep swim in the sea, both the Deep-fried \"Live\" Soon Hock & Poached Cod Fish worth the attempt. Silky with loads of freshness in the meat. No fishy stench, only clean tasting in some clear light broth that didn't required much seasoning - simple & flavourful. Try Stir-Fried Scallops with Honey Beans - enjoyed a few tender & silken mollusks nested within some great crunchy pods with a stir of Chinese olives, its briny nature accentuate the sweetness in them.","1189":"We ate here for a dim sum lunch. \u00a0It was the week before Chinese New Year so we saw several people having the \"yu sheng\" and they seemed to like it. \u00a0But we were in the mood for dim sum. \u00a0All in all, it was really hit or miss. \u00a0The BBQ pork buns (fried ones, \"char siew sou,\" or \"cha shao su\" in mandarin) were good, as were the shrimp dumplings (\"ha gow\" or \"xia jiao\" in mandarin) and the rice roll (\"chang fen\" in mandarin; we had scallops). \u00a0But the steamed dumpling siew mai (or \"shao mai\" in mandarin) were really terrible--extremely salty and with a strange aftertaste, although not necessarily of bad meat or anything. \u00a0I couldn't put my finger on it. \u00a0We couldn't even finish a serving of it, and the wait staff didn't bother to ask why we barely touched that dish. \u00a0Another couple of things were just OK but not worth describing in detail. \u00a0We left feeling not too satisfied, and after an hour were hungry for something else anyway. \u00a0So, I doubt we'll come back despite the nice interior.","1190":"I was worried the recent reviews were a sign of decline - a restaurant which picked up Michelin recognition and packed in any effort.I was wrong. This was a fantastic meal. We split the lunch set (10 pax).The crispy rice chips were perfectly crisp and paired well with the prawn and chicken. The Tom Yum Soup was very refreshing and mildly spicy. The Chicken Wings and Scallops were also excellent.The Green Curry was nothing special and the Pomfret was too heavily fried - but the desserts (the Tapioca especially) rounded off an excellent meal with great service.","1191":"Really really good thai food.I was very impressed with this restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice although people still dress quite casually and the service is generally quite good. The prices are reflective of the atmosphere, but it's absolutely worth it for a delicious thai meal. I will go back again and again - especially for the tom yum soup. Only negative was they do not have a liquor license right now, but you can bring your own and pay a corkage fee.Food:Tom Yum soup - incredible, must order. Note, it is a bit spicyGreen Curry - Very goodDuck curry - very goodSpring rolls - good, but not blown awaypad thai - very goodPineapple rice - very good","1192":"The main good thing about this place is the reasonable pricing. Otherwise, the food is extremely average and non-innovative. Nothing palatial about the ambience or service.","1193":"Not good. Got the jungle curry with prawns which was very watery. The prawns were very fishy and not good and made the whole dish fishy and funky. Then I found a bug in my food. The red curry with chicken was just ok, thin and vegetables were undercooked. Portions are small and not worth the price tag. Go to golden mile, you can get a curry twice as good for half the price","1194":"Gluten free! Yep, a Thai restaurant in Purvis St and it is safe to eat in :-)I love Singapore - this is my 3rd visit in a year for work but being gluten free has been hard. In Asia and I want Asian food but every time I show my diet card, I'm told 'nothing for you here'. We found Shingthai near the top of Purvis St and I was glad we did. The menu says to check with staff over dietary requirements so I did, gave my order and was told that was ok. I had the spicy beef salad and the pineapple rice with pork and prawns. Both were stellar dishes. Lovely medium cooked slices of beef and they didn't stint on the beef either. The pineapple rice was fab too - beautifully flavoured with a great balance of sweet and savoury.I'll be honest and admit I didn't pay much attention to the decor and didn't use the toilets. Food came fairly quickly so once that was on the table, we all munched away. The meals come when ready so not starter then main style but that was fine for us.We were $40 sing for starter and main and a drink. Portions are pretty large per person and many dishes can be made to share too. Well worth a visit and as a gluten free person, a fab meal that was safe for me :-)","1195":"Food was average to good quality. Seemed like an overpriced tourist trap, I mean who charges extra for plain rice on top of a $20 lunch entree. Staff not friendly at all, maybe as there were only 2 in our party ? \u00a0Restaurant itself is very clean and spacious and had good a\/c, unlike many of the cheaper lunch places that cram people in.","1196":"Absolutely fantastic food and service.In Australia we're treated to a grand choice of Thai cuisine, but this is hands down the best Thai I've eaten, including when I've been to various places in Thailand. Whilst the stuffed chicken wings seem to be the house's speciality, it was the red duck curry, fresh papaya salad, strip-steak salad that were my personal favourites. The strip-steak salad actually comprises excellently grilled steak, rather than the dry, chewy, beef you're often treated to in many Asian cuisines.The staff were very busy, as the restaurant is quite popular on a Saturday, but still managed to provide prompt service with a smile.The one thing I will warn of though, and this is by no means a negative, is that when a dish is typically served with chilli in Thailand, expect it to be close to as hot as the Thais like it.For my wife, this was a step too hot, but for me, I loved it.In Australia we're used to \"white person\" hot where the dishes have a mild kick and it was a (somewhat welcome) surprise to have some face-melting chilli in the mix. If you're sensitive to heat, ask them to tone it down a notch. I also assume this is why locals order more modest (aka bland) dishes and we were the only ones with interesting looking food on our plates.One last little trinket if you've made it this far: avoid the glutinous rice and durian. It's served like porridge and unless you really REALLY like durian (and that sort of rice + custard + fruit style) avoid it and order something else. It's not often I'm smiling at the end of a meal. I think this may be my favourite Singaporean meal, if not one of my favourites ever.","1197":"We came here with some regulars for dinner to celebrate a belated Father's Day. The restaurant had a very good ambiance and is very nicely decorated with many carvings on the wall. It was completely full as well so it was good that we managed a reservation. We started with some thai standards - the fish cake, thai papaya salad, Tom yum kung, pandan chicken and their famous stuffed chicken wings. Having eaten loads of thai food in the past, I have to say that the starters were good. I especially enjoyed the pandan chicken dish and the stuffed chicken wing. They had different dipping sauce with the different starters which allowed us to do a bit of mix and match. The stuffed chicken wing was unique - chicken meat stuffed back into the wing and fried. The pandan chicken was very well done and had a good sauce to accompany. The tom yum was also well done - clear broth with loads of lemongrass and packs a nice punch. We followed with a fried grouper, roast duck red curry and stif \u00a0fried Kang Kung. All very well done - the fried grouper came with a sweet spicy accent and the roast duck red curry was yummy & mildly spicy. All goes well with a bowl of rice. We ended with the tup tim krob and the mun chium. We love the tup tim krob but have been frequently disappointed - it was surprisingly good here. Itis a coconut broth filled with the 'red rubies' (pieces of chestnut soaked in some syrup n covered with a layer of red colouring) and slices of jackfruit & coconut. A lovely ending to a good night - Pricing is steep but we all had a good time.","1198":"We always visit Yhangtai Palace when we stay at Intercontinental Hotel in Bugis, Singapore. \u00a0Very satisfied with the quality of the Thai food. Enjoyed every dishes on the menu. Come and try the restaurant.","1199":"The other delicious food was gobbled up before I can take a photo.Pomelo salad is awesome. A little on the sweet side but such a great appetizer. We also always order the stuffed chicken wings, always a crowd pleaser.The deep fried pomfret is also great. It doesn't come as a whole fish though, it is cut into a few big pieces.The olive rice is easily the best you can find in town. You have to like olive though because their version here comes with a very generous portion of olives all fried within. Tossed it with some tiny lime pieces and chilli, it is brilliant and totally hits the spot.End it with mango sticky rice and tapioca!","1200":"Food here has become more expensive than it used to be. The portions are also so much smaller. Even though food is still good, it is not as satisfying as it used to be.","1201":"The best Thai food I have ever eaten outside of Thailand (and I consider myself quiet picky when it comes to food). Truly delicious. We had the Pomelo salad, the Tom Yum soup and the steamed pawns in chili sauce. Cannot wait to go back.","1202":"Good overall restaurant, though pricy for what you get and staff a bit more focused on the drink than the food.The food was authentic, though execution varied dramatically. The stuffed chicken wings, mango salad and the mango sticky rice were exceptional. The green curry average. The betel leaf salad, winged bean salad and red ruby dessert were pathetic. So a bit all over the place, and disappointing at some level. The ambience is nice, and a pleasant alternative to the otherwise super-basic crammed low-end or gaudy, gilded and cushioned high end that makes up most of the Thai alternatives in the city. A relaxed, spacious and modern appointment in a space that still feels like the shophouse it is. If these guys could start feeling a little less cool, and focus on their customers and their food this could be a really nice place to go.","1203":"Along the stretch of shophouses restaurants at Purvis Street, you will find Yhingthai Palace, a restaurant that serves authentic Thai-Chinese cuisine. The ambience is nice and cosy with cushiony walls and Thai d\u00e9cor. To complete any Thai meal, there has to be Tom Yum Soup. The rendition of the Tom Yum Soup here is clear and tangy as compared to the red and creamy one that is served at other restaurants. The clear broth is very palatable but a tad too spicy. The fresh and succulent prawns in the soup make up for it though. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice too, which was delightfully fragrant and flavorsome. The pineapple, egg and prawns in the rice all contributed to the aroma, while the pork floss on top completed the dish. All in all, a pleasant experience and I would patronize this restaurant again to satisfy any Thai food cravings.","1204":"Delicious thai food! Bf's foodie friend recommended it, so how can it go wrong.. Haha. I'm not sure about pricing though, didn't see too much of the menu. Might be a little on the higher side, I'm guessing. Pretty nice ambiance, nice cushy red decor on the walls, servers dressed in bright red\/pink colours.We had:1. Iced lemongrass pandan drink ($3.50) - nice and refreshing!2. Tom yum clear soup ($7 per bowl, I believe) - our friend said to order it clear if we didn't want too much spice, else it'd come with quite some amt of chilli oil and could be pretty spicy!3. Pomelo salad - mm! yum. Interesting that there was a bit of char-grilled something in it. 4. Khao Tang Nah Tang - rice cracker with minced chicken coconut curry type dip - delicious! Rice cracker on its own tasted like one of those Want Want rice crackers, so that alone was pretty good. But when you spoon the dip on.. Mm! Comfort food!!5. Signature fried fish - indeed, as our foodie friend described, dry fried outside but still moist and flaky inside, with delicious mango sauce to go along!6. Green chicken curry - mm! my favourite. tender chicken, 7. Red beef curry - pretty good too, actually. Good textured beef, bamboo shoots, mm![both curries had these tiny ball-like pea eggplants in them, very cute! slightly bitter. also these larger rounder Thai eggplants which somewhat resemble tomatos on the inside]8. Thai fish cake - came with delicious plum sauce!9. Pandan chicken - very juicy and well grilled! Also came with dark soy sesame sauce of some sort10. Olive rice - SO GOOD. I hadn't had olive rice before, but this has converted me. I normally shun olives. There was some sort of waxed chicken or something that came with it, pretty interesting.. somewhat sweet.11. Seafood fried rice - can definitely taste the oil, but sinfully yummy. Quite a bit of seafood too! crab, prawn, squid, etc12. Stuffed chicken wing - our foodie friend said these are the BEST stuffed chicken wings he's ever had, and I have to agree. Bursting with flavour (again, very juicy chicken, mushroom, asparagus - which stuffed chicken wing has asparagus?!) and well fried!13. Mixed veges - normal oyster sauce veg, yay for lotus root. Quite a mix of veg but nothing spectacular, just standard veges. cauliflower; broccoli; asparagus; carrots; snow peas...I stole some of my bf's durian glutinous rice - it was somewhat surprising though, came in kind of a porridge type sauce. Not really what I expected - I thought the normal was durian on the side and glutinous rice, the way mango and sticky rice is served. Foodie friend's staple is red ruby, which I would've loved to try, but could not stuff another morsel down!","1205":"Authentic excellent Thai food. \u00a0Best to go in groups but the basic and classic thai dishes are all done to perfection. \u00a0The only \"complaint\" is the slightly chewier duck curry (but the curry taste was super yum). \u00a0If you're a Tom Yam fan, the soup is a MUST. \u00a0Clear (spicy) broth is done at its best.","1206":"Long ago, when my mother was a little girl, she used to stay at one of the shop houses along Amoy Street. Now and again, my grandmother will buy home a pack of lor mee around the corner of their street - known as Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee. Both my grandmother and my mom claim that the taste has not changed much since that time. In fact, my grandmother, who has difficulty walking, insisted on climbing up the stairs to the second floor of the food centre so that she can have a big bowl of the lor mee from Yuan Chun every time we pass by that area (that was before we knew there was a lift). I was introduced to it enthusiastically by my grandmother and mom when I was young and has been going down to Tanjong Pagar just to have a bowl whenever I have the time. The lor here is so good that I can finish the whole bowl, including the sauce. They also have fried ngoh hiang and fish strips - all the ingredients that a traditional bowl of lor mee should have.Try to go earlier (before 11.30am) on weekdays as office folks working in Tanjong Pagar area starts pouring out for lunch and the queue can be very long, although it moves really quickly.","1207":"The stall is located at the second floor of the hawker centre and has been around for a long time, occupying 2 stall spaces. Currently it is closed on thursday and friday. The minimum order starts from $4. Here it is self service style. One has to order and collect at the stall. I had been eating at the stall since I was young. I felt that the serving was getting smaller while price had increased too. The amount of fish meat in the serving had reduced a lot. It used to be chunky fish overflowing. I like that the yellow noodle did not have the \"Kee\" taste. The dish still tasted not bad.Best come during holiday when there is no office crowd. There will be no queue.","1208":"These guys deserve their reputation and the long queue. Instead of a starchy sauce you get a bowl packed with flavour - just the right balance of vinegar, chili and a generous serving of ingredients. All for the very reasonable price of $3 (regular) or $4 (large).","1209":"Let's get this out of the way: This is the best Lor Mee I have come across. The gravy is completely unique compared with what other Lor Mee stalls offer. Far more savoury and less starchy than its competitors', it is genuinely addictive, and I make sure to patronise this stall at least once every fortnight. Besides the thick broad noodles bathed in their signature gravy, you also get pieces of pork belly, fish, and fried prawn cakes. For all these you pay $2.50 (it used to be $2), talk about affordability!There's almost always a queue (because it really is that good), but no worries, the folks are very adept at whipping up bowl after bowl very quickly. Be sure to ask for extra vinegar and crushed garlic. Also, the stall is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.","1210":"Absolutely fabulous! !!! It is no wonder that it is so famous! Their supply of fishes for steamed fish is soooo fresh!!!I love their prawn meat rolls! We ordered:1. Steamed fish with bean paste (my first time eating it with bean paste)2. Sambal Kang Kong3. Fried prawn meat rolls4. Salad prawns5. Hotplate tofuYum!!! Every plate was wiped clean!I am definitely coming back again!!!","1211":"This place is packed every day for a good reason. The grouper we ordered was fresh and perfectly steamed. Equally delicious was the braised pork belly, which was simmered in an umami-rich soy sauce perfect for spooning over rice. Even the beverages here are far from ordinary: we all had the popular soursop drink, freshly squeezed from the fruit. Expect to pay around $30+ per pax.","1212":"I don't really eat bitter gourd, but the salted egg with bitter gourd here is really to die for. It doesn't taste bitter at all and has the aromatic egg yolk with fried eggs. i suspect salted bean curd is added to the dish as well. This is one dish you definitely have to order when you're there.This store also serves Curry Fish head as depicted on their signage, but they are also popular for steam fish and teochew porridge. Driving all the way to Jurong is definitely worth it - remember it only opens in the afternoons though!","1213":"This stall actually serves a large variety of food apart from the usual curry fish head.I ordered the steamed shark head and pomfret following the recommendations of my friends, and to put it simply, the two dishes were excellent! The pomfret was especially fresh and did not have that fishy flavor that you would find in fish that is not so fresh anymore. However, one thing that I disliked was that the service is not as friendly, probably because they were very busy with customers. No smiles, just quick and cursory service. But anyway, I was here for the food so I did not care too much about the service either.They also serve some simple yet delicious dishes, such as fried eggs with minced meat and long beans with belacan. Both dishes were excellent and went well with whatever fish that we were eating. Do give this stall a try and you won't be disappointed.","1214":"Made a special trip all the way to Jurong to try their food after my mum brought home takeaways from this stall.Must-trys is this fish of bitter gourd and salted egg. This was delish. I don't really enjoy bitter gourd but when cooked this way, the salted egg took away its bitter taste!It seems like the must try dish here is also the steam pomfret and pig trotters.You can choose to order a plate of rice with 2 dishes (cai peng style) at $3.50 or order cue char style. Overall the prices here are quite reasonable.","1215":"Xiao Long Bao in my opinion better than Din Tai Fung and cheaper. 10 for $5.50. The xlb are tasty and soupy. Made fresh in front of you and served steaming hot :) I appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients yet the complexity of the flavors. Such a simple dish but so tasty. I'll definitely be back. Others were also ordering the Szechuan dumplings or wonton which looked really good too.","1216":"Food: 2.5\/5.0Service: 2.0\/5.0Value: 3.0\/5.0Decor: 1.5\/5.0Overall: 2.5\/5.0Everyone wants to be a hipster, and that means taking really mediocre food in dingy stalls and talking it up like it's some gift from above. \u00a0Lets get real, these are at best decent XLB for a hawker stall, but even trying to compare these to DTF is absolute fake news. \u00a0The non-XLB items are completely mediocre (read: ugh). \u00a0Pass.","1217":"In terms of hawker xlb this would be one of the good ones. I still think the soup should be more oily and sticky. The skin is correct. I suppose so far din tai fung will be the most authentic although a bit \" too clean\" in flavor. For the price I think you get your money's worth. 6 for 10.","1218":"The only place I've ever tried XLB was at Din Tai Fung in Seattle. Even though others love it, I never thought it was that good and just assumed XLB was supposed to be that way. My views on XLB changed after going to Zhong Guo La Mian. For about $4.50 USD you get 10 amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed XLB that packs so much amazing flavor that you'll crave for months. If I can find a way back to Singapore, this spot is a must stop.","1219":"All-in-all, Din Tai Fung still wins in my opinion, as I prefer the flavor of the DTF xiao long bao filling. The skin here was somewhat inconsistent, and if you weren't very delicate and careful, it would break, letting the soup leak out. Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar.","1220":"Best XLB in #Singapore is found at Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao in Chinatown. #1 the steamed mini buns... basically pork dumplings but the fat from pork melts out of the meat into the bun and is kinda soupy in the buns... OH MY GOD! So good!!!!!!! #illeatforyou #XLB","1221":"Wildly delicious and exceptionally convenient - XLBs will be the end of me. \u00a0I will move into the Chinatown Complex and find refuge with Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao. \u00a0There is something uniquely satisfying about eating dumplings prepared before your eyes. \u00a0It's nostalgic....a taste of innocence. \u00a0One bite and they'll have you. \u00a0They'll \u00a0own your time and your wallet. \u00a0 \u00a0While I am reluctant to admit this kind of uncouth behavior, I can devour 30 dumplings in one sitting! \u00a0;-)","1222":"This place does different types of dumplings and some noodles as well. I sampled the dumplings and they are pretty decent, not that they are amazing in any way but the pan-fried dumplings are good and 10 for 5.5 SGD is a good deal.The line was not long when I was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place I could consider returning to.","1223":"Kreta Ayer market is just a labyrinth on the second floor, chocked full of food gems to be discovered. One such example, Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao.As in the namesake, you should get an order of the xiao long baos. At 10 for $5, they're a good deal, and while a little less refined than the ones from Din Tai Fung, these feel more homely and very satisfying. The soup dumplings are really juicy and the broth has good flavor. They often make the dumplings to order so there might a be a little wait as they prepare the dumplings and place them right into the steamer. It's totally worth it though.","1224":"Ya, if they were open.... so disappointing that I had to settle for Hawker Chan but it should be a good alternative.... yelp didn't show that this is closed though.....hope to try it again soon but for now is 1 star...","1225":"It's not bad. But I dont think it's gonna win any awards soon. I ordered the szechuan spicy noodles and pan fried dumplings.You cant order half portion for the dumplings. So it's all or nothing. The dumplings are good, but I've had better. But for hawker centre standards.. 7\/10.The noodles has a peanut sauce base, but it was lacking in dimensions. About 6\/10 not a big fan, but it was decent.I was just too lazy to queue for the other award winning stalls.... I'll come back to try their xiao long bao next time","1226":"Good, solid xlb that can satisfy any craving with the additional delight of having paid just $5.50 for 10 dumplings!! Found this on Yelp and no regrets about trying it. I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung. My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it. Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal. It makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap can't be found easily in the US :( P.S I gotta try this Good Beer Company everyone's mentioning :p P.P.S. The store is #02-135 for those struggling to find it as I did: it's near the edge of the complex! And across from Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken store of Michelin fame.","1227":"I have eaten at this establishment a few times now and usually I just walk up to the counter and order a batch of freshly made xiao long baos, but today was a good 10 minutes wait. Not that I'm complaining, it was totally worth it! The wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love. So I'm not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy - I know, I know, don't lynch me! - it's just my preference (and don't get me started on those tang baos). But don't get me wrong, the meat filling isn't dry by any means. I find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin. For a little variety try them in different combination of sauces (soy or vinegar only, and mixed) and with\/without ginger. Try with ketchup ... ok, just kidding. The other nice thing is the reasonable price of $5.50\/10 pieces, come on. Great taste for a great price, go give this place a try.","1228":"We had to come here twice because the first time, they weren't open. It was 3pm so make sure to not come then. The second time we came at 515pm and they were open for business. I ordered the XLB and spicy pork dumplings. Both were super delicious. The couple owners were so nice and helpful too. They made me feel very welcomed at their food stand.","1229":"$5 for 10, whether it be xiao long bao, guo tie, boiled dumplings or steamed ones.I was meeting Jireh H and Amanda L for a drink at Good Beer Company. I was early and craving dumplings, decided to walkabout to survey the offerings. Started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them. Finally found the dumpling shop run by 2 cheery China guys.I started with an order of boiled dumplings. Once the others took a taste, they started really getting into it. We ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie.The xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it, I think it's Chinese wine. These and the pot stickers (guo tie) seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders. I prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as I find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying. The dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside. People were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes.I give 5 stars not because these are the best I've ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price. There's also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot. You can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting..free entertainment!","1230":"Best Xiao Long Bao I've ever had by a good margin. More homestyle than Din Tai Fung, the dumpling skins were slightly softer and more glutinous, and the soup was very flavorful. The pan fried dumplings and Shanghai spicy noodles were also fantastic. An excellent meal for two for $14 SGD. Pair with some Tiger beer for an over the moon street food experience. Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!!","1231":"I can confirm the other reviews are accurate! \u00a0GREAT dumplings. \u00a0Cheap. \u00a0Worth a trip.","1232":"Simply the best XLB I've had. $6\/10 now and still worth it. Their other dumplings looked great too. Grab a beer at Good Beer, for ($3.50 SGD!) and a spot overlooking the courtyard.","1233":"After an hour into waiting in line for one of two Michelin star food stalls, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle, we decided to pick up some soup dumplings to tie us over. The dumplings were fresh (they actually make them in front of you), juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin. These were better than any that I've had at Din Tai Fung or any other soup dumping restaurant, and it was only $6 for 10. Definitely worth checking out while you're in Chinatown.","1234":"I cheer for the underdogs. Well, 99% of the time...only because 1% seriously should stay that way.I typically spit at the favored ones. Well, nearly 99% of the time because they tend to get over-hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable. After all, the endless banter causes your brain to think they are PERFECT because of how they are marketed right?This probably explains my utter distaste towards Din Tai Feng (especially the two overcrowded spots in LA that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area). Don't get me wrong, they are decent. Quite good at best...but nothing mind-blowing. So when people keep saying that Din Tai Feng is the ONLY to-go spot for GOOD dumplings...bile begins to form in my mouth.Fast-forward to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao...you'll find two very friendly and hardworking PRCs (wanted to say Chinese guys but changed it PRC to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking AWESOME; they should be culinary ambassadors) kneading dough and forming Xiao Long Baos (hereafter, XLBs) one after the other with their magical fingers. They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"\/Definitely-recommendNOTE: I've had it 5 times so far (20-30 each time) and the best time is usually dinner after a long line. Why? I went at lunch and my 20 XLBs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones I've had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made.Yelp 100: 36\/100","1235":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place, as trying to locate a stall inside the overwhelming Chinatown Complex hawker center can be a daunting task. This place does not disappoint. I had 10 steamed XLB which costed me $5.50 SGD ($3.82 USD). As I slurped each of the delicate and succulent XLBs, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the broth has a sweet umami flavor. The skin was tender but strong enough to keep all the fillings in without breaking when I picked up the XLBs with my chopsticks. Many reviewers have compared this place's dumpling to DTF - an unfair comparison given that DTF is a huge global franchise. In my opinion, this place is way better than DTF. I would not hesitate to come back again and again.","1236":"Yes, the xlb is really good. Nice broth and tasty. The stall is found in the southeast corner of the Chinatown Complex, which is behind the CK Dept. Store. Everything is made to order, so you do have to wait a few minutes.","1237":"OMG... I can't believe I found this place amongst all the food stands in Chinatown Complex! We went to Chinatown complex looking for the Good Beer Company but since it was dinner time thought it would be great to get some food too especially because we were in a gigantic food court.After walking around the food court for 10 mins, I found this little shop selling xiao long bao. The couple at the shop were hand making them as you order. They were selling them at 10 XLBs for 5.50 Singaporean dollars (incredible!) I ordered 10 to share with the hubby, we finish them in 2 mins and went back to get 20 more! They were delicious and much cheaper than restaurants like Din Tai Fung...etc.Totally recommend going there if traveling in Singapore!","1238":"This is my new favorite food stall at the Chinatown Smith Street Hawker Center. Excellent dumplings! Cheap! Only $4.50 for 10. The xiao long bao are great, but you HAVE to try the potstickers. They take a little longer to fry up, but definitely worth the wait. The spicy dumplings are a close second. The hawkers are really friendly and never turn anyone away when they are trying to close. (Although once the sign goes off you'll only get xiao long bao.) I've noticed that there are a lot more fellow ang moh in the queue with me lately. Probably no coincidence that so many reviews start with \"I was going to Good Beer Company and...\"","1239":"$5 for 10 awesome xiao long bao! \u00a0One lunch my colleagues and I descended on the stall like a horde of locusts ordering over a 100 of the xiao long bao along with wontons, pan fried dumplings and la mian. \u00a0Every dish was tasty and consistent in quality. \u00a0While the xiao long bao may not be as thin skinned as \"the best\" restaurant dumplings, they are my favorite on this island especially given their incredible value for money.","1240":"Best XLBs in all of Singapore. Don't waste your money anywhere else, especially not Din Tan Fung. They go down perfectly with some Good Beer Company beer :) and for 5$ for 10, how could you go wrong? Still unbelievable how they haven't changed their prices in two years and how you still only wait 5 minutes for 40 XLBs!","1241":"The xiaolong baos were better than I would have thought. The soup was sweet and delicate, and it was just pretty delicious. The boiled dumplings were pretty decent as well, with loads of chives, but not as good as the xiaolong baos. I have to try the potstickers next time! :)","1242":"Went for dinner and found this stand on the second floor of the Chinatown complex. I was on a mission to find this stall along with the Good Beer Company and it was a sucess. \u00a0I ordered 10 \"steamed mini buns\" for $5.50 and the uncle there was busy hand making them. \u00a0Mine were premade as they were not busy when I stopped by so they already had some waiting but they did taste very fresh. \u00a0I ate them both with and without the ginger vinegar dip and actually
